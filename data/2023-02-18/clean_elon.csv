19, Allowing users to make some of their Lists optionally public would be great
20, Minus gas tanks
21, It is still far too difficult to find out that Lists exist and then create them. UI modifications coming to make them easy to discover and offer great lists made by others (like Spötify playlists).
22,"Yes, worth noting that accounts you follow on Lists are private"
23, Yikes

Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed.

But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3."

106,[Oversized font &amp; undersized paragraph spacing will be fixed this week]
107,"Long day at Twitter HQ with eng team

Two significant problems mostly addressed:

542, That’s the plan!
543, Maybe there’s a way to do this by placing an ad below tweet details
544,"Also, there will be a higher priced subscription that allows zero ads"
545,Ads are too frequent on Twitter and too big. Taking steps to address both in coming weeks.
546, 🤣

604, The pendulum has swung a bit too far
605," Even if you tax every billionaire in America at 100%, it barely makes a dent in the national debt. In the end, the government will be forced to tax everyone to pay the debt.

Btw, $31T doesn’t include unfunded liabilities, which are *much* higher."

How is WEF/Davos even a thing? Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?"

Basically saying if you love trashing *that* account, then you will probably also love trashing *this* account. Not actually wrong lol."
671, Should Twitter keep it active?
672," This is a rare case where I agree with Jacobin.

Increasing quality of life for the aged is important, but increased lifespan, especially if cognitive impairment is not addressed, is not good for civilization.

We are already ruled by a gerontocracy!"
673," BBC is at least honest that they are the *British* Broadcasting Corporation, unlike many others …"
674," Well, your account handle is literally BanTheBBC haha!

675," There are some really funny WEF parody accounts, although it’s legit hard to tell WEF truth from WEF parody sometimes!"

Those who favor censorship should remember that it is only a matter of time before censorship turns on you.

There will always be some censorship, but less is better."

This is why $8/month with phone and optional ID verification, as well as organizational affiliation, is so important."
1816,AI is getting really good
1817, Exactly. That’s why I’m encouraging people to interact with Twitter more!
1818, 🤣
1819," Compared to AI, progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess, as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices.

There is no regulatory oversight of AI, which is a *major* problem. I’ve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!"
1820," View count will show how many people actually see tweets, just as is done for videos. You will sometimes have a video view count of 1M with only 20k likes!"
1821," The problem is that likes are public, subjecting people to criticism, and “like” is often the wrong description, as you often just think something is interesting or notable, but not likable. 

We need to add these critical distinctions."
1822," Twitter will start showing view count for all tweets, just as view count is shown for all videos. The system is far more alive than it would seem."
1823," Have you clicked on your tweet analytics (little bar graph)? 

Those who read tweets outnumber those who reply/retweet/like tweets by over 1000%."
1824,"I meet so many people who read twitter every day, but almost never tweet.

If I may beg your indulgence, please add your voice to the public dialogue!"
1825, 🤣
1826, Agreed
1827, Looking into it
1828, Digging into this now
1829,Lot of people stuck in a damn-that’s-crazy ChatGPT loop 🔁
1830," There still isn’t a good strawberry picking robot, but researchers are working on it.

As they apply AI to maximizing how many strawberries get picked, it might do whatever it takes to get more &amp; more planted, until eventually there are strawberry fields forever …"
1831,"As a reminder, tap the stars icon on upper right of screen to switch between latest people you follow and recommended tweets"
1832, Always wondered about that bear …
1833,"Twitter is purging a lot of spam/scam accounts right now, so you may see your follower count drop"
1834, Exactly
1835," We are now confident that the Neuralink device is ready for humans, so timing is a function of working through the FDA approval process"
1836, Yup
1837,Exciting Neuralink update in 30 mins!
1838, 😉
1839, Congratulations!
1840,"Good conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so."
1841, Cancel culture needs to be canceled!!
1842," Wow, thank you for the kind words"
1843, Feels like an eternity ago
1844,Thanks for taking me around Apple’s beautiful HQ
1845," Exactly. The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections. 

Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed."
1846,Update from at 6pm PT
1847, Exactly
1848, Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.
1849," Much more, but I am simply stating the obvious"
1850, We’re implementing anti-bot bots. You should see some improvement by tomorrow.
1851,"Microservices …

1853, 🎯
1854," Sam lost me when he said that any lies at all would justify Trump losing. 

I mean … Sam literally wrote a book about why lying is evil!
"
1855, Accurate prediction
1856,A little more progress to Mars
1857," Several other major Democrat politicians attacked me too, all around the same time. It was coordinated.

Outside of party leadership and independents like Manchin, they are essentially actors on the political stage, not directors or script writers."
1858, Sam used to be so rational! There is such a thing as too much meditation …
1859, 🤣
1860, 🤣
1861, Correct
1862," Don’t love the name, but the drink itself is amazing &amp; brings me joy 😀"
1863, This is a serious problem
1864, This makes sense
1865,The people have spoken …
1866,"If Community Notes can correct me, then obviously they can correct anyone. This is a good example. They were right to add the label."
1867, I think I have been very specific
1868, It’s a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
1869, That one was real too
1870," The reason satire about CNN proposing censorship of Twitter could so easily be construed as reality is because that is the prevailing sentiment of the media!

Satire is reveals a deeper truth."
1871, This will forever be our top priority
1872,"This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead."
1873," This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead."
1874, Exactly
1875," Absolutely, especially if done in collusion with the government"
1876,The Twitter Files on free speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself. The public deserves to know what really happened …
1877, Why are so many in the media against free speech? This is messed up.
1878, A revolution against online censorship in America
1879, Support is greatly appreciated!
1880, 🍿
1881," Wow, they don’t sound biased at all!"
1882,Did you know Apple puts a secret 30%  tax on everything you buy through their App Store?
1883,"Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why"
1884, Secret suppression of free speech by Apple. Customers were never told. What the hell is going on here?
1885, Yes
1886,Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers
1887, Here works
1888,Accurate
1889, Are you suggesting Apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt Tesla?
1890,Who else has Apple censored?
1891, What terms?
1892,What’s going on here?
1893,Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?
1895, FTW!
1896, Lmaoooo
1897,"Greetings, I’m Musket, Elon Musket"
1898, Hearting things that you just want to highlight is questionable

1900, Good for you!
1903, 🤣
1904,There is no excuse for my lack of coasters
1905," Yah, it’s mostly basic"
1906,My bedside table
1907,The amount of pro psy ops on Twitter is ridiculous! At least with new Verified they will pay $8 for the privilege haha.
1908, Your anti-dictator stance is as controversial as it is brave. From whence cometh your 💰?
1909, 💯
1910, I’m optimistic that we will make some progress
1911, Yup
1912, Exactly
1913," That American media would argue *against* free speech in America – within the bounds of the law – is an utter travesty.

Shame on them! Shame, shame, shame."
1914," That might be cool to show publicly, now that you mention it"
1915, You probably weren’t blocking 4000 accounts per second
1916, Friends have asked me if there’s a way to recover their old vine videos! Will look into it.
1917, System obviously needs immediate alerts for any sudden spike in database writes of any kind
1918, That’s literally how I found out!
1919, It’s on the todo list
1920,Twitter experienced slight degradation of service today from an old 3rd party tool used to block accounts that had no rate limit (sigh). Should be fixed now.
1921, This whole thread is making your point for you
1922, Absolutely!
1923, Working on it
1924, ESG is the devil
1925,And I am paying $8 btw :)

1927,"Just a note to encourage people of different political or other views to engage in civil debate on Twitter.

1929, Good old random partial reinforcement gets ya every time!

1931," Fortunately, I work late. Would you like fries with that?"
1932," Note, spamming, whether done by a set of humans or bots is against ToS"
1933, Like digital ventriloquist dolls 🤣
1934, Was also due to me that we got trademark to use Tesla Motors as initial name &amp; later obtained URL
1935, He is invited!
1936, Or maybe just … bots 🤷‍♂️
1937, They’re bots in human form
1938, ArtCenter College of Design gave me an honorary degree for my work on the original Tesla Roadster
1939," More importantly, I was head of product and led the design of the original Roadster. Eberhard was wealthy and could have risked his money, but was unwilling to do so."
1940," For many celebrities, it’s actually their manager or “team” writing their tweets. Might be the case here."
1941, Seems like NPC to PC ratio is super high!
1942, Good question
1943, They won’t give up controlling the narrative easily …
1944, Good idea
1945, True
1946, Correct
1947, I think I see a path to Twitter exceeding a billion monthly users in 12 to 18 months
1948, He can drive it himself if he wants!
1949, 🤣🤣
1950,Slides from my Twitter company talk

1957," The goal is a trusted digital town square, where a wide range of views are tolerated, provided people don’t break the law or spam. For example, any incitement to violence will result in account suspension."
1958, Better
1959, 🤣
1960, Suggestions are welcome Mr. 👑
1961, 🤣💯
1962, Tonnage to orbit is the better metric
1963, Correct. Good thread.
1964," This alleged expert is saying things that are flat-out false. I have now said several times of Twitter that incitement to violence, obviously including threats of physical harm, will result in account suspension."
1965, Will look into it
1966, I wonder what Earth will be like 88 million years from now
1967, Most people still have no idea. FSD is the most important software release of any kind in a very long time.
1968, He is infected with a mental version of this physical virus
1969, That the mind virus is pushing humanity towards extinction is not hyperbole
1970,Simpson’s predicts I buy Twitter S26E12
1971, It’s insane! I’m just fighting for free speech in America.
1972, But Twitter as a platform must be fair to all
1973, Yes
1974, Yup
1975, Wow
1976," But freedom of speech is the bedrock of a strong democracy and must take precedence.

My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far."
1977," As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump"
1978, Interesting development
1979," I’m fine with Trump not tweeting. The important thing is that Twitter correct a grave mistake in banning his account, despite no violation of the law or terms of service.

Deplatforming a sitting President undermined public trust in Twitter for half of America."
1980," I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone"
1981, Concerning
1982, Calling for violence will result in suspension
1983, Absolutely
1984," Incitement to violence will result in account suspension. 

Currently suspended accounts will be enabled slowly next week after manual review to determine whether they have potentially broken the law or engaged in spam.

Twitter will be a forum for the peaceful exchange of views."
1985, Accurate
1986," If it actually becomes a problem, we will take those and other steps"
1987," Deliberate impersonation/deception will result in account suspension.

1988, The clawback may be their biggest fear
1989, Exactly
1990," I am neither conventionally right nor left, but I agree with your point. 

The woke mind virus has thoroughly penetrated entertainment and is pushing civilization towards suicide.

There needs to be a counter-narrative."
1991, We can aspire to turn it to the betterment of all
1992,What do you think of the culture war?
1993," That is a disturbing story and very concerning that Twitter took no action, despite clear violation of ToS. Report in this thread for now."
1994," All verified individual humans will have same blue check, as boundary of what constitutes “notable” is otherwise too subjective.

Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.

Longer explanation next week."
1995, Incitement to violence will result in account suspension
1996," Sorry for the delay, we’re tentatively launching Verified on Friday next week. 

Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates. 

Painful, but necessary."
1997, Interesting … now pay $8
1998, Much Ado About Nothing
1999, But you have piqued my curiosity … who are these “online experts” you speak of?
2000, AP is such an expert in misinformation. Twitter couldn’t hope to compete!
2001, Mars plans are still moving forward
2002, How can it be both illegal and “by the court”? Twitter must abide by the laws of each country or get shut down.

2018,"I have half a mind to wag my finger at the 1500 accounts that caused the spike, but I shall forebear 🙄"

2023, Fun level on Twitter has definitely increased! I’m having a great time tbh.
2024,Hate speech impressions down by 1/3 from pre-spike levels. Congrats to Twitter team!
2025, Working on it
2026," They need to exist to stop scams, spam, NSFW &amp; illegal stuff from going viral, but they should obviously not be used for political purposes"
2027," It is objectively the case that “conservative” political candidates were more negatively affected than “progressive” candidates.

Anyone using Twitter knows this. Question is simply one of magnitude."

2033, This is one the biggest failures in US journalistic integrity of the 21st century
2034," Lol, but actually true"
2035," The more I learn, the worse it gets. The world should know the truth of what has been happening at Twitter.

Transparency will earn the trust of the people."
2036, 💯🎯
2037, Good point. Conflicts of interest should be made readily apparent to the reader.
2038, Just wow …
2039, They should get a “SBF-Affiliated Media” label 🤣
2040, Yup
2041, 🤣
2042, That’s why he won’t answer
2043," To be direct, the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false SBF ownership of Twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill."
2044," All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company, but he did not do so. Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did, when in fact he owns 0%. 

For the last time, how much of you does SBF own? Stop dodging the question."
2045, Yes
2046," To be fair, there are many people at Twitter working late into the night, for whom I have great respect"
2047, 🤣
2048,Awesome new Twitter merch!
2049," It has been really bad. Far left San Francisco/Berkeley views have been propagated to the world via Twitter. 

I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone watching closely.

Twitter is moving rapidly to establish an even playing field. No more thumb on the scale!"
2050, It’s not a real publication
2051, 🤣🤣 with maybe a little editorial help from SBF’s employees
2052, This is awesome
2053, No grey area. Flat wrong.
2054, On the other *did* take the SBF money and won’t disclose how much SBF owns of them
2055, I did not take the money. SBF/FTX do not own shares in Twitter.
2056,"World Cup traffic hit almost 20,000 tweets per second today! Great work by Twitter team managing record usage."
2057, Headline: “Stephen King Tweet Causes My Pillow Sales to Skyrocket!” Lmaooo
2058, Haha sorry code release towards end of next week should allow this again
2059," No. He may have owned shares in Twitter as a public company, but he certainly does not own shares in Twitter as a private company."
2060, There was a time when you cared about the truth. That is long gone.
2061," As I said, neither I nor Twitter have taken any investment from SBF/FTX. Your article is a lie. 

Now, I’m asking again, how much of you does SBF own?"
2062, It was getting to the point where the minimum impulse bit for a Silicon Valley startup was a billion dollar market cap!
2063,"Should Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam?"

2070," According to Obama’s DoJ, the Ferguson shooting was unequivocally self-defense, so the Ferguson protests were – if you believe Obama’s DoJ – based on a false premise.

That’s not to say that other injustices don’t occur, but this does not appear to be one of them."
2071, Full text:
2072, What conspiracy theory? This what Obama’s DoJ published:
2073, Looking into it

2209, Red Bull does work tbh
2210, Definitely need to improve Twitter’s dopamine/cortisol ratio!
2211, I agree
2212, 🤣🤣
2213,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely – my variant on Occam’s Razor
2214, Twitter search will add feedback loops to improve result rank based on which result you click on &amp; whether you immediately click back (implies wrong result)
2215," Notes from last night:
- Maybe deprecate TLS this week, as only needed if Android app &gt;1 year old.
- Home mixer computes Home  ~10X faster than Timeline.
- Ad mixer can greatly improve relevance at cost of lower total ad views. More interesting the ad, more time you look at it."
2216, Most accurate would be to require access to phone GPS for location-specific polls
2217, Yes
2218,Fascinating to watch Twitter Trump poll!
2219, Bot &amp; troll armies might be running out of steam soon. Some interesting lessons to clean up future polls.

2229," Verification through the payment system plus phones, but allowing pseudonyms is the least bad solution I can think of"
2230," When polls are about a significant question, even those who don’t follow me tend to hear about it. That said, I agree with the idea of an all-user poll. Should also be an all-user by country poll."

2245,"Kathie Griffin, Jorden Peterson &amp; Babylon Bee have been reinstated.

Trump decision has not yet been made."
2246,"New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.

Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted &amp; demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. 

You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet."

2265,And … we just hit another all-time high in Twitter usage lol
2266," The best people are staying, so I’m not super worried"
2267," Don’t wanna jinx it, but there’s a chance we can keep Twitter alive …"

2274," Current class-action law is actually a massive tax on the American people and desperately needs reform. It is one of the reasons medication is so expensive in the USA.

Somehow, other countries do just fine without class-action law."
2275, The actual attackers in class-action lawsuits are the law firms. They just find someone in the class to be their puppet.
2276, Ok
2277, We’re working on something that should rank replies automatically
2278,Twitter is like open-sourcing the news
2279, Polycule 🔥🔥

2312," My apologies, this will be fixed within a week, two at most"
2313, Agreed. What will matter in the future is how many Verified followers you have.
2314, We’ll widen V11 beta before Thanksgiving
2315, Hard to say who’s celeb &amp; who isn’t. Being able to sort by follower count &amp; disallowing deliberate impersonation probably solves this.
2316, All unpaid legacy Blue checkmarks will be removed in a few months
2317," With new release, changing your verified name will cause loss of checkmark until name is confirmed by Twitter to meet Terms of Service"

2336, Ligma &amp; Johnson are welcome back anytime
2337, I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere.
2338, (cue Obama giving himself a medal meme)
2339, Exactly
2340, Server control team knows because they stop working from time to time. That’s why they have the “critical 40” list.
2341," True. Server side can (and has been) brute-forced, but that can’t solve weak Internet connections &amp; older phones.

Worth noting that Twitter in India &amp; many other countries is slow even on latest iPhone."
2342," Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space, so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website"
2343," There are ~1200 “microservices” server side, of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all, according to server control team. 

Trimming down that 1200 number, reducing data usage, serialized trips &amp; simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use."
2344," Twitter is very slow in India, Indonesia &amp; many other countries. This is fact, not “claim”.

10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common. Sometimes, it doesn’t work at all, especially on Android phones.

Only question is how much delay is due to bandwidth/latency/app."
2345, Mr. Munger’s words are much appreciated
2346, 🤗
2347, Malenia battle was next-level intense
2348," Yes, although it seemed almost impossible at times"
2349, The ratings on this simulation are incredible
2350, Definitely
2351, Why is Twitter unusably slow in many countries? Seems odd that this would be bandwidth only.
2352," Yeah, I hate it"
2353,"By the People,
For the People"
2354,Twitter is All the News
2355," Next test is ~20 sec firing with max oxygen fill to test autogenous pressurization, possibly one more static fire, then orbital launch attempt"

2361, Did seem a little Dr Evil tbh haha
2362," This is an external analysis, not from Twitter. It is lower than Twitter’s published mDAU."
2363,Sìì!
2364, Full test duration of 14 engines
2365,Recent trend is promising
2366, That’s what I said!
2367," In some parts of the world, refresh takes 30 seconds"
2368, How many serial requests are made by app to refresh timeline?
2369, And we will finally stop adding what device a tweet was written on (waste of screen space &amp; compute) below every tweet. Literally no one even knows why we did that …
2370, Part of today will be turning off the “microservices” bloatware. Less than 20% are actually needed for Twitter to work!
2371," I was told ~1200 RPCs independently by several engineers at Twitter, which matches # of microservices. The ex-employee is wrong.

Same app in US takes ~2 secs to refresh (too long), but ~20 secs in India, due to bad batching/verbose comms. Actually useful data transferred is low."
2372, That is not good
2373, This is up to the Tesla board
2374, Can you cite specific instances of significance?
2375, I have Tesla covered too. Will be there part of this week.
2376, That’s the bizarre part
2377, 🤣💯
2378, How was it proven?
2379," Yay, he’s investing in Tesla!"
2380, A question worth asking
2381, I’m ready through the list right now
2382," True, the food is great. 

The fact that you don’t realize that there are up to 1200 “microservices” being called when someone uses the Twitter app is not great."
2383, Interesting
2384, It’s on my list to review. How urgent is this?
2385, That is my philosophy
2386, Umm … no
2387, SpaceX Starlink bought a tiny – not large – ad package to test effectiveness of Twitter advertising in Australia &amp; Spain. Did same for FB/Insta/Google.

2401, Good summary!
2402, I do
2403, Will look into it
2404, 🤣💯
2405, Twitter is super slow on Android. What have you done to fix that?
2406, Then please correct me. What is the right number?
2407," False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ. Badge in records show peak occupancy was 25%, average occupancy below 10%.

There are more people preparing breakfast than eating breakfast.

They don’t even bother serving dinner, because there is no one in the building."
2408, Yup
2409, 🤣
2410, Increasing granularity about what “verified” actually means is the right move
2413, 🤔
2414, 🤔
2415, I think you’re great
2416, I can’t tell
2417, Especially bizarre given that almost no one came to the office. Estimated cost per lunch served in past 12 months is &gt;$400.
2418, 🤣
2419," I hope they keep cursing me on Twitter, as it increases advertising revenue!"
2420, 🧐
2421, We will enable organizations to manage affiliations

2423,"Btw, I’d like to apologize for Twitter being super slow in many countries. App is doing &gt;1000 poorly batched RPCs just to render a home timeline!"
2424, Cool :)
2425," Ultimately, I think there is no choice but for Twitter to be the final arbiter, but I’m open to suggestions"
2426,"Rolling out soon, Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them"
2427, Coming soon

2432,Twitter feels increasingly alive
2433," I like both you and Mike! It’s just that Twitter at its core is a software &amp; servers company. The technology needs to evolve rapidly, which requires a technologist."
2434, No
2435," SBF was a major Dem donor, so no investigation"
2436, 🤣🤣
2437, And why does your pp have a mask!?
2438, Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody?
2439, Rollout will broaden roughly every week
2440, Fond memories
2441, 🤣💯
2442, Ok …
2443, Probably next month
2444, Going without saying that we all want ASS (Actually Smart Summon) ASAP!!
2445, No way
2446, Making Tesla Superchargers &amp; connectors available to all is the right thing to do
2447, Spaces should be evolve. It has potential to be truly great.
2448, Probably end of next week
2449, My reaction to SBF was … different
2450, Twitter at its best!
2451, 💪💪
2452, 🎯
2453, Yes
2454," This is false. Anyone who can be in office, should be. However, if not logistically possible or they have essential personal matters, then staying home is fine.

Working remotely is also ok if their manager vouches for excellence.

Same policy as Tesla &amp; SpaceX."

2474,We’re adding a “Parody” subscript to clarify
2475, 🤣
2476," Full answer to insulin price question is complex. Short answer is that original insulin, discovered in 1921 (not 1923), is inexpensive, costing as little as $25. 

New, higher efficacy analog variants of insulin are more expensive.
"
2477," It used to be:

“Internet guy will fail at rockets/cars!”

Now it is:

“Rockets/cars guy will fail at Internet!”

Literally from same media outlets 🤣🤣"
2478, lol
2479, Maybe should be default off? Subscriber is a way better name.
2481,"Mainstream media will still thrive, but increased competition from citizens will cause them to be more accurate, as their oligopoly on information is disrupted"
2482, True
2483,This is from the video arcade &amp; bar area

2500, I agree
2501, Absolutely
2502, Yes

2506,Usage of Twitter continues to rise. One thing is for sure: it isn’t boring!

2525,Are you seeing far fewer bots/scams/spam?
2526, It’s awesome 🫐
2527, Pretty funny though 🤣🤣

2532," Rollout of new verified Blue is intentionally limited just to iOS in a few countries with very little promotion. 

As we iron out issues, we will expand worldwide on all platforms."
2533," In days to come, we’ll add granularity to verified badge, such as organizational affiliation &amp; ID verification"
2534," We are changing the text to say “Legacy Verified. Could be notable, but could also be bogus.”"
2535, 🎯😎💰
2536, Subscription Blue is better than legacy Blue. I switched over.

2549, I just killed it
2550, Actual fun stuff FTW!!
2551, 😎
2552," Should be noted that a significant percentage of these accounts are not real people, but some proportion are"
2553," This is super messed up. Unfortunately, many such things occurred at Twitter. Even worse was done in later years. 

Meaningful growth happens when utility &amp; entertainment value improve. That will be our focus going forward.

No more fake numbers &amp; pseudo growth."
2554, When reality is indistinguishable from satire
2555, ✌️

2576,And I’m open to the idea of voting Democrat again in the future
2577, 🤣🤣💯
2578,"To be clear, my historical party affiliation has been Independent, with an actual voting history of entirely Democrat until this year"
2579, True
2580," Like most people in America, I agree with some of the Democrat and some of the Republican policies, but not all.

However, if executive and legislative branches are dominated by *one* party, then we lose balance of power."
2581,"Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who’s in charge!"
2582,"To independent-minded voters:

Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic."
2583,"But if Twitter is bird, that’s means … 🤯"
2584,Back when birds were real
2585,How times have changed
2586, We do
2587,"Twitter rules will evolve over time, but they’re currently the following:"
2588, Birds haven’t been real since 1986
2589, $8 for all
2590, Exactly
2591, Not everything needs to have “bird” in the name! Too many bird groups fighting each internally other at Twitter. Angry Birds.
2592, Birdwatch gives me the creeps
2593, Community Notes aka
2594, 🤣
2595, For $8
2596," But if she really wants her account back, she can have it"
2597," Actually, she was suspended for impersonating a comedian"
2598," At the end of the day, if Twitter is indeed the most accurate source of information, more people will use it"
2599, As judged by the people of Twitter via Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch)
2600, Absolutely
2601, You represent the problem: journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information. That’s the big lie.
2602, I will look into this
2603, Accurate
2604,"My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk"
2605,Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That’s our mission.
2606," Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced.

And these are very early days. As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth, it will be indispensable."
2607, No problem to use a pseudonym. The high-level principle is just that verified users can’t engage in malicious deception.
2608, 🤣
2609," We are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation, as well as collective use of Verified accounts by a single individual or organization"
2610,Widespread verification will democratize journalism &amp; empower the voice of the people
2611, No exceptions
2612,Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
2613,"Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning. 

This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue."
2614, What censorship are you referring to?
2615,"Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying “parody” will be permanently suspended"
2616, We can beat that
2617, Worth watching
2618, Fixing search is a high priority
2619, Noted to fix
2620,Search within Twitter reminds me of Infoseek in ‘98! That will also get a lot better pronto.
2621, Interesting
2622," 42 mins to start, then several hours in a month or so"
2623, We definitely need to incent people to do a lot more interactions on Twitter!
2624, 🤣
2625," We can do 42 min chunks at 1080 resolution now for new Blue, so you could break up a longer video. The 42 min limit should be fixed next month.

How does YouTube monetization work &amp; what could Twitter do better?"
2626, Absolutely
2627," Hopefully, less than a month"
2628, Absolutely
2629, Two weeks
2630, Something like that
2631,Followed by creator monetization for all forms of content
2632,"Twitter will soon add ability to attach long-form text to tweets, ending absurdity of notepad screenshots"
2633, Couple months
2634, True
2635," Great question. Twitter will suspend the account attempting impersonation and keep the money! 

So if scammers want to do this a million times, that’s just a whole bunch of free money."
2636,This rocks
2637," So long as pay $8, please be my guest"
2638, 🙏
2639," That is weirdly tricky due to the way Apple handles “subscriptions”. If you subscribed to the old thing, it’s not super smooth to subscribe to the new thing. We’re working on it."

2641, Yup
2642, Hot take: not everything AOC says is 💯 accurate
2643, This feature is an absolute gamechanger for fighting mis/disinformation at scale
2644," As soon as we confirm it’s working well in the initial set of countries and we have the translation work done, it will roll out worldwide"
2645, Making great actuators for a humanoid robot is a surprisingly hard problem
2646, I still do a lot of work at Tesla! Was at our Palo Alto engineering office until late Thursday night when I had to redeye to NY.
2647, 🤣💯
2648," Far too many legacy “verified” checkmarks were handed out, often arbitrarily, so in reality they are *not* verified. You can buy as many as you want right now with a Google search.

Piggybacking off payment system plus Apple/Android is a much better way to ensure verification."
2650, Correct
2652, Birdwatch (soon to be renamed Community Notes) has incredible potential for improving information accuracy on Twitter!
2653,"Trash me all day, but it’ll cost $8"

2656, I try my best
2657," Thank you. 

A thermonuclear name &amp; shame is exactly what will happen if this continues."
2658,"Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.

Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required."
2659, Twitter will not censor accurate information about anything
2660,"Again, to be crystal clear, Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.

In fact, we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press."
2661,Excellent summary of Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety from the head of the team
2662," Hank, try a Google search …"
2663, 🤣💯
2664, 🤣🤣
2665, Agreed. Working on it.
2666, And therefore Twitter should die?
2667, You’re right
2668,"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.

Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America."
2669, Absolutely
2670, That assessment is more accurate than most people realize
2671, 🤣
2672," Unsure if confirming or denying that 
I’m an alien is more convincing that 
I’m an alien"
2673, maybe we’re already in it

2681,A neuron doesn’t realize it’s a neuron
2682," Pretty much, or at least one of the hive minds"

2690," Your feedback is appreciated, now pay $8"
2691,Advertisers should support:

2694, $8
2695,Twitter is simply the most interesting place on the Internet. That’s why you’re reading this tweet right now.
2696, The system is working 🤣
2697,Being attacked by both right &amp; left simultaneously is a good sign
2698, Quite a few companies like this
2699, Works every time
2700, 🤣🤣
2701, Capital allocation should be done by those best at doing so
2702, Still a fair bit of polish to be done on 69.3. It’s a major release posing as a minor release.
2703, Some good ideas here
2704,you get what you pay for
2705," If verified accounts violate terms of service, eg spam/scam/impersonation, they’ll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!

We will definitely add cool stuff like what you’re suggesting to Twitter Blue."
2706, Thanks Michael
2707, Absolutely agreed that the Twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints
2708, Exactly!
2709," The community notes feature is awesome. 

Our goal is to make Twitter the most accurate source of information on Earth, without regard to political affiliation."
2710," Twitter's content moderation council will include representatives with widely divergent views, which will certainly include the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence"
2711," Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks"
2712," Talked to civil society leaders,,,,,, Ken Hersch &amp; about how Twitter will continue to combat hate &amp; harassment &amp; enforce its election integrity policies"
2713, I think so
2714, Exactly!
2715, 👀
2716,Twitter speaks to the inner masochist in all of us
2717, It’s the user’s own setting that did this
2718,Totally stole idea of charging for insults &amp; arguments from Monty Python tbh
2719,"To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8"
2720, Yup
2721, That already happens very frequently
2722, 💯
2723, Falcon Heavy is a testament to the awesomeness of humanity
2724, Sounds like a good idea
2725, 🎯
2726,"There will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure, which is already the case for politicians"
2728," Yes, this will destroy the bots. If a paid Blue account engages in spam/scam, that account will be suspended. 

Essentially, this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude."
2729, Absolutely essential. Creators need to make a living!
2730,This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators
2731, Exactly
2732, 🤣👻
2733,And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us
2734,"You will also get:
- Priority in replies, mentions &amp; search, which is essential to defeat spam/scam
- Ability to post long video &amp; audio
- Half as many ads"
2735,Price adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity
2736,"Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit. 

Power to the people! Blue for $8/month."
2737,Sonic BOOMS!!
2738,Falcon Heavy launch in ~30 mins
2740, I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots &amp; trolls.
2741, We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?
2742,😉
2743,Halloween with my Mom

2749, Definitely
2750, 🤣
2751, Looking into it
2752, This is just temporary
2753, Twitter’s commitment to brand safety is unchanged
2754,"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!"
2755," The Guardian used to have balance (moderately left) and integrity, but now it is a far left wing propaganda machine. I hope they get back to where they were one day."

2764,"Wachtell &amp; Twitter board deliberately hid this evidence from the court. Stay tuned, more to come …"
2765," All news has bias, some more than others"
2766, 🤣
2767,This is fake – I did *not* tweet out a link to The New York Times!
2768, I’ve now been through so many hero to villain cycles I’ve lost count
2769, 😢
2770, What an incredible creature!
2771, The whole verification process is being revamped right now
2772, This is false
2775," Tweeps will be twits going forward, as the latter has vastly more gravitas"
2776, Pretty much
2777, There seem to be 10 people “managing” for every one person coding
2778,But Management 201 is such a tantalizing carrot …

2791,Fresh baked bread &amp; pastries are some of the great joys of life
2792," Good point. 

Being able to select which version of Twitter you want is probably better, much as it would be for a movie maturity rating. 

The rating of the tweet itself could be self-selected, then modified by user feedback."

2794, One of the best trolls ever 🤣🤣
2795, Something like this makes sense
2796, Ace reporting by 🤣🤣

No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes."

2818, 👻
2819,Meeting a lot of cool people at Twitter today!
2820,Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!
2821, 🤣💪
2822, 🤣
2823, Definitely closer to citizen journalism – local news orgs are under-appreciated &amp; should get way more prominence on Twitter
2824, Nobody bats 1000 🤷‍♂️
2825,A beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism – people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias
2826, I’m a big fan of citizen journalism!
2827,“According to unnamed sources close to the matter who wish to remain anonymous” 🤣🤣
2828,"“The New York Times has emerged as a new, chaotic actor in global politics. The paper’s interventions in some of the world’s most combustible conflicts have sometimes been a boon, but their messaging has also caused problems.”"

2849, Important
2850, Yup
2851, Exactly!
2852, 🤣
2853," Yeah, doesn’t make sense"
2854, Good thread
2855, I only play crazy 9’s
2856," That’s the plan, unless it is damaged in testing. What really matters is that ship &amp; booster production line is spooling up. Also, each new ship &amp; booster has incremental design improvements."
2857," Yeah, I’m back to spare bedroom /couch surfing at friend’s houses in Silicon Valley, which I did for about a decade.

Frankly, I like it this way, as I get to see my friends, who I love, more often."
2858," I did as a child, but found it to be too simple to be useful in real life: a mere 8 by 8 grid, no fog of war, no technology tree, no random map or spawn position, only 2 players, both sides exact same pieces, etc.

Polytopia addresses these limitations."
2859," And I don’t even own a house, let alone a “mansion”, you douche"

2866, Absolutely!
2867, Interesting
2868, Great game
2869,"Maybe it was a social media algorithm, not even people"
2870,Think about who might have decided “The Current Thing” before accepting it
2871,"Who decides “The Current Thing?”
Real question. I don’t know."
2872, Exactly. WaPo are such hypocrites.

2889, Cool
2890," 🤣🤣 

Although there could be more R&amp;D in candy tbh. Feels like there hasn’t been much improvement in decades."
2891, 🤣
2892," Headline is misleading. Starlink can obviously offer far more robust positioning than GPS, as it will have ~1000X more satellites over time. 

Not all will have line of sight to users, but still &gt;10X GPS &amp; far stronger signal.

Just not today’s problem."
2893, One of my favorite conspiracy theories is that the world is actually 80% men
2894, un ass ailable logic!
2895, Yes
2897," You’re right. Eventually, we all run out of time."
2898,"Only Giga Berlin can make these colors, as paint shop was specially built to apply many fine layers of paint, giving it complexity not otherwise possible"
2899," Varies a lot. Tesla &amp; SpaceX are in good positions, but many other companies are not. 

Recessions do have a silver lining in that companies that shouldn’t exist stop existing."
2900," Those who want Putin removed are laboring under the misapprehension that whoever replaces him will be more amenable to peace or western philosophy, but I think this is unlikely – the Kremlin is not the Nice Guy Olympics"
2901," Russia overrunning Ukraine would destabilize the entire region, perhaps the world"
2902," If Russia faced calamitous defeat in conventional warfare for something as strategically critical as Crimea, the probability of using nuclear weapons is high"
2903, I do. Yes.
2904," Still very unlikely, but this is the closest we’ve been since Cuba in ‘62"
2905," Just guessing, but probably until spring of ‘24"
2906, It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event
2907, “Brutal for both sides” will be a common phrase in the months to come

2914, Pretty good troll tbh
2915, *humour
2916, I couldn’t agree more 😜
2917, British humor is the best
2918, Compromise is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome – just a question of how much death &amp; destruction happens before then
2919, That should be the nature of the debate
2920," Most probable outcome by far is a horrible war of attrition that destroys Ukraine &amp; severely damages Russia, with massive body count on both sides.

And, in the end, the same outcome. 

So why?"
2921, Exactly
2922,Congrats to team on 48th launch this year! Falcon 9 now holds record for most launches of a single vehicle type in a year.

2936," Several major architectural upgrades in 10.69.3, so it’s much more than a point release, but we’re sticking with 10.69 just cause haha"
2937, Sounds fair
2938, Definitely giving me kid naming ideas 🤣
2939,And … sold out!
2940,Internet in airplanes will feel same as if you were accessing Internet at home!
2941,"28,700 bottles of exquisite Burnt Hair perfume already sold! 

Only 1,300 left of this unique, limited edition, collector’s item."
2942, We’re working on it. Hope to release something next week.
2943," No money from DoD, but several other countries, orgs &amp; individuals are paying for ~11k/25k terminals (thanks!).

SpaceX is losing ~$20M/month due to unpaid service &amp; costs related to enhanced security measures for cyberwar defense, but we’ll keep doing it (sigh)."

2954, (Actually) Smart Summon is almost done
2955, Yes
2956, I have a plan
2957, Thanks Optimus :)
2958," To be precise, 25,300 terminals were sent to Ukraine, but, at present, only 10,630 are paying for service"
2959, SpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding
2960," Wrong analogy. America also had a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one in America sees that country as part of America.

Crimea *is* seen as a crucial part of Russia by Russia, much as Hawaii is seen as a crucial part of America."
2961, 🎯🤣
2962, Probably not
2963, Practice makes perfect …
2964," Russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by Ukraine. 

But what you don’t want to do is give Russia a choice of total, humiliating defeat or nukes – then the probability of them using nukes is high."
2965," Obviously many disagree with this logic, but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about WW3. 

If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools."
2966," But, hey, look on the bright side! At least Russia doesn’t get Crimea in that scenario, so you can be comforted by that thought, while watching the mushroom clouds rise."
2967," If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO, they will use nukes, then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over"
2968," Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia. 

Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.

From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor."
2969, Exactly
2970," If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.

We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose? 

If we nuke Russia back, they will nuke us and then we have WW3."
2971,Exceptionally well-said
2972," Standard (non-performance) 3 &amp; Y suspension in production now has improved comfort, without affecting handling"
2973," Yeah, RV version is lower priority than standard version. 

You should still see high speeds during off hours. Is that happening?

As we add more satellites &amp; upgrade satellite technology, speeds in high user density locations should see significant increases."
2974,"Ok, we will add a donate option to Starlink"
2975," That’s oddly low. Normally, much higher."
2976,Are there others that want to donate Starlinks to places in need?
2977, Ok
2978, 🤣 that’s happened to me many times
2979, A much quieter leaf blower is possible
2980," This is harder than it sounds, but ok"
2981,Deus X Machina

2997,"Pitching my idea once again for a crossover of Das Boot &amp; Boss Baby.

“Das Baby” – Hijinks on the high seas!"
2998," Just a scratch, we can buff it out"
2999, Mostly accurate
3000,The comments in this thread are a conspiracy theorist’s wet dream
3001, Yup
3002, 7 years ago
3003, Definitely one of the strangest meetings I’ve ever experienced. was there too.
3004, I’m trying my hardest to de-escalate this situation and obviously failing
3005," Damned if you do, damned if you don’t, so … guess I’m just damned"
3006," Starship &amp; next-gen Starlink satellites are key, but much risk lies ahead before those are working at scale"
3007, The hilarious thing is you’re not wrong 🤣
3008, So it goes …
3009, Fate loves irony
3010," Even so, we should still do good deeds"
3011,"The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free"
3012," That dude is not just a “condition of anonymity” spineless coward, he’s also an ignorant fool. Starlink was directly requested by the Ukraine government, as it was the only thing that worked."
3013," It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress, as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war."
3014," DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context."
3015, Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better.
3016," The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically, GPS doesn’t work on battlefields, as the signal is easy to jam, but Starlink does."
3017," Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.

In any given year, there is a chance above zero that they will be launched. We are now at the highest risk in 60 years.
"
3018," Curses, foiled again!"
3019, 😉
3020, Accurate
3021," Russia has the ability to destroy USA &amp; Europe utterly with nuclear missiles in less than 30 minutes &amp; vice versa.

A surprising number of people don’t know this.

Of course, it would be MAD to use them, but it is also MAD to be in this situation at all."
3022, This has potential
3023," Internet fiber, phone lines, cell towers &amp; other space-based comms in war areas have been destroyed. 

Starlink is all that’s left. For now.
"
3024, Thank you for clarifying this 💙🇺🇦💛
3025," Starlink is the primary communications system of the Ukrainian army on the war front. If anyone else wants this job, please be my guest …"
3026," Big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms. 

Starlink is only comms system still working at warfront – others all dead. 

Russia is actively trying to kill Starlink. To safeguard, SpaceX has diverted massive resources towards defense.

Even so, Starlink may still die."
3027, Concerning
3029, Are there citizens of nations who are helping Ukraine on this list?
3030," But surely no reasonable person would launch nuclear war?

The problem with that logic is if we were dealing with reasonable people, we wouldn’t have war in the first place."
3031, Is this list real? What’s the URL?
3032, People should never fear turbulence. Commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending.
3033, The right question to ask
3034, We’re just following his recommendation 🤷‍♂️
3035," Falcon can probably get Starlink past breakeven, but Starship is needed to fund Mars"
3036, Yes
3037," In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain &amp; replenish satellites &amp; ground stations &amp; pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways. 

We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks &amp; jamming, which are getting harder.

Burn is approaching ~$20M/month."
3038," Also, Starlink is still losing money! It is insanely difficult for a LEO communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy – that was the fate of every company that tried this before.

When asked what the goal of Starlink was at a space conference, I said “not go bankrupt”."
3039, Maybe the 🐈 got their 👅
3040, Very few in Iran so far
3041," Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors in space launch &amp; communications, Lockheed &amp; Boeing, who get over $60B …

Wouldn’t be surprised to find this particular individual working there when he retires from DoD. Corruption at its finest."
3042," SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable."
3043, Vital to the future of consciousness
3044, 🤣
3045, srsly
3046, Next week
3047, Envy has driven him to madness
3048," Starlink requires nothing except ~50 Watt power source. With a small solar system plus battery or a generator, you will have connectivity anywhere."
3049, True
3050, There are some active terminals
3051," Of course, this happens almost every day. They successfully destroyed Viasat in Ukraine several months ago."
3052," Starlink has faced relentless jamming attacks &amp; SpaceX relentless cyberwar. So far, their success has been limited."
3053, Noted
3054, Starlink data usage growth in Ukraine
3056,"20,000!!"
3057, Cool
3058, Maybe with .3
3059,This is real
3061," 🎯 “My opinion is Burnt Hair is just Elon saying, chill out, have a laugh, and share a laugh.”"
3062, Oh the irony 🤣🤣
3063,"We might need a different name, as this is basically just Starlink with roaming capability, so you can take your terminal anywhere."
3064, The counter-intuitive thing is that it’s actually gonna be a sick product!
3065,"Please buy my perfume, so I can buy Twitter"
3066,And right on cue 🤣🤣 …
3067, You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.
3068,Doesn’t get more lit than this!
3069,BE the change you want in the world!
3070,Can’t wait for media stories tomorrow about $1M of Burnt Hair sold 🤣
3071,"10,000 bottles of Burnt Hair sold!"
3072, 💯🎯
3073,Over 5000 bottles of Burnt Hair sold!
3074,An omnigender product
3076,"With a name like mine, getting into the fragrance business was inevitable – why did I even fight it for so long!?"
3077,And you can pay with Doge!
3078,The finest fragrance on Earth!
3079, Nobody should trust Bremmer
3080,Maybe one day we can finally achieve
3081,The next question one is typically asked is “Have you tried ayahuasca?”
3083, Not subtle
3084," Sam, there is a such a thing as meditating too much"
3085," Yes, back to regularly scheduled programming"
3086," Pointless, as there is currently no overlap between Russian and Ukrainian demands – it’s not even close"
3087," No, it is not. I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space."
3088," Talked to ye today &amp; expressed my concerns about his recent tweet, which I think he took to heart"
3089, It was built &amp; paid for at my request. Hunter &amp; team did great work.
3090, 💯
3091, It will
3092, Strange
3093," I have no desire to become involved in wars, but it is safe to say that all bets are off if the nukes start flying"
3094, Strong candidate to win most counter-intuitive product of the year!
3095, Important to bear in mind when reading anything
3096," Indeed, that kinetic energy scales with the square of velocity is not well-appreciated!

A sealed escape pod with a heat shield would probably work."
3097, So many blind spots
3098, 🎯
3099," There are ~25k terminals in Ukraine, but each terminal can be used to provide an Internet uplink to a cell phone tower, so potentially several thousand people can be served by a single terminal"
3100,Coming soon from The
3101," Yup, it will float"
3102, Too busy trying to survive at the time
3103, They were invited to further their career elsewhere
3104, There is a giant 30ft (literal) fork in the road outside the Autopilot office in Palo Alto
3105, Mine
3106, I love the inverse poetry of making metaphors literal
3107," That is quite an interesting story. We sent what appeared to be identical emails to all, but each was actually coded with either one or two spaces between sentences, forming a binary signature that identified the leaker."
3108,Because it runs recursively
3109, Nuclear war probability is rising rapidly
3110,An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind
3111, Perhaps we can talk again today?
3112," True, Starlink provided a decisive battlefield advantage"
3113, I’ve been up all night trying to think of any possible way to de-escalate this war
3114, Feels so long ago. A pleasant memory :)
3116, Double-header

3124, Two Dragons on
3125, Can’t wait to see this beast in action!
3126, Even better build coming next week
3127," Quite a few. Trying to do the right thing, which is not always clear."
3128, I am in regular contact with Fedorov
3129," Bad reporting by FT. This article falsely claims that Starlink terminals &amp; service were paid for, when only a small percentage have been. 

This operation has cost SpaceX $80M &amp; will exceed $100M by end of year.

As for what’s happening on the battlefield, that’s classified."
3130, Starlink will provide the vast majority of bandwidth from space
3131," You’d need an electric propeller mounted on the tow hitch to go faster than a few knots. 

There might a creative wheel hub design that can generate meaningful thrust."
3132, Norway rocks! ♥️♥️ 🇳🇴 🇳🇴

3140, I think being able to dial the content you see from “warm &amp; fuzzy” all the way to “bring it on mf!” is the way to go
3141," Software engineering, server operations &amp; design will rule the roost"
3142, There will be very rapid product evolution
3143,500 mile range &amp; super fun to drive
3144,Excited to announce start of production of Tesla Semi Truck with deliveries to on Dec 1st!

3158, 🤣
3160, Cute. You can get surprisingly close to a wild baby rhino &amp; Mom if you stay downwind.
3161, There are no angels in war.
3162, Accurate assessment
3163, Correct
3164," So they’re saying that not buying Twitter is bad, but also buying Twitter is bad!?"
3165, We talked via videoconference last year
3166, 🤣
3167,War is the ultimate Supreme Court
3168, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia almost certainly do not want to join Russia – annexation of those regions was done to ensure a land bridge and water supply to Crimea
3169," Obviously, not everyone who voted for the pro-Russia party wanted to join Russia, but it would also be inaccurate to say that none did."
3170, Below is the electoral map of 2012. Blue is the pro-Russia party.
3171," Assuming you believe that the will of the people matters, we should, in any given conflict region, support the will of those who live there. 

Most of Ukraine unequivocally wants to be part of Ukraine, but some eastern portions have Russian majorities and prefer Russia."
3172," First of all, Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years &amp; we didn’t ask for this one – GM &amp; Ford did"
3173, 🤣
3174,"Another batch of Starlinks in orbit, 7 hours after the astronaut launch"
3175, That wouldn’t be hard to do
3176, 🤣
3177, Twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original vision
3178," I do not think it is simple at all, but I have yet to hear any realistic path to peace.

Ukraine has achieved many brilliant tactical victories, but should be wary of overconfidence leading to strategic defeat.

When Russia fully mobilizes, millions on both sides will die."
3179, 10.69.3 will actually be a major upgrade. We’re keeping .69 just because haha.
3180," Twitter probably accelerates X by 3 to 5 years, but I could be wrong"
3181,"Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app"
3182, 🤣
3183," Should be noted that Starlink is still far from cash flow positive. All LEO communications constellations to date have gone bankrupt, so any support is super helpful."
3184," A small number of terminals were paid for by the govt, vast majority were not. This is just another bs WaPo hit piece."
3185," I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world."
3186," We gave Starlinks to Ukraine &amp; lost $80M+ in doing so, while putting SpaceX &amp; myself at serious risk of Russian cyberattack.

What have you done besides tweet?"
3187," SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable &amp; support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far. Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously, we are pro Ukraine.

Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death, probably fail &amp; risk nuclear war. This would be terrible for Ukraine &amp; Earth."
3188," In other news, remote controlled anal beads sold out everywhere"
3189, 🤣
3190," That referendum was questionable, which is why I suggested repeating it under UN (or other trusted entity) supervision"
3191," Great, offer a UN supervised vote and if Russia refuses, then war it is"
3192, Maybe a similar approach to Kosovo
3193," No, I’m suggesting voting under UN (or pick your most trusted entity or country) supervision"
3194," Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating.

Russia has &gt;3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace."
3195," You are assuming that I wish to be popular. I don’t care.

I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome."
3196,Let’s try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas &amp; Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine
3197, Cheese is amazing
3198, Indeed. Biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.
3199, The bot attack on this poll is strong!
3200," The will of the people should decide whether they are part of Russia or Ukraine, but Russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of Ukraine"
3201,"Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war"
3202,This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then
3203,"Ukraine-Russia Peace:

- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.

- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).

- Water supply to Crimea assured.

- Ukraine remains neutral."
3204, Yes
3205, That is my assessment too
3206," Well-said! Also, we try to operate the team as non-hierarchically as possible &amp; allow movement between project areas, so you don’t get pigeon-holed."
3207," I’m trying my hardest! Perhaps more people might consider loving humanity. 

Our collective light of consciousness is a tiny candle in a vast darkness. Please do not let it go out."
3208, Optimus will be sickkk

3222,Do not let ancient grudge break to new mutiny
3223, So many talented Russians in America
3224, Customer experience suffers when there is an end of quarter rush. Steady as she goes is the right move.
3225, War always gives ample reason for vengeance for all sides. Only by overcoming this instinct can there be peace.
3226, Smoothing out crazy end of quarter delivery wave to reduce expedite costs &amp; relieve stress on Tesla team. Aiming for steadier deliveries intra-quarter.
3227," It’s funny reading simultaneous criticism that it’s already been done, but also it’s impossible 🤣"

3281, Extremely concerning
3282," How ironic, that’s what Henrik Fisker did to Tesla in 2007! Karma is a …"
3283, They need to add a lot of batteries to the grid to buffer energy
3285,I guess this joke is a slow burn … 🥁
3286, Big improvement in high speed cross-traffic velocity NN coming next month

3331, This is true
3332," With some improvements, it will achieve 300 Mps"
3333," Incorrect. There was tuition for students from outside the school district, which was a small part of the student body, incl black students, but not for students in district, which I was.

Also, I was there for 2.5 years, previously attending govt schools for 9 of 12 years."
3334," I went to government schools, not private, except for part of one year in third grade"
3335," Probably Q2 next year, with vehicles initially transferred by boat from Port of Brownsville to the Cape"
3336, 🤣
3338," That’s the plan. We’re taking a little  risk there, as engine isolation was done as retrofit, so not as good as on Booster 9."
3339," Late next month maybe, but November seems highly likely. We will have two boosters &amp; ships ready for orbital flight by then, with full stack production at roughly one every two months."
3340," Our focus is on reliability upgrades for flight on Booster 7 and completing Booster 9, which has many design changes, especially for full engine RUD isolation."
3341, Exactly
3342, Seems that way

3461," Exactly. Ecosystem is almost entirely dependent on the sun already. 

Civilization’s energy needs are absurdly tiny compared to what the sun sends us for free (~1 GWh/day/km^2)."
3462," Yup, there’s a reason we do static fires! Much better to break things on the ground than en route to orbit."
3463," Solar panels, ground mount &amp; rooftop, paired with stationary batteries, will be civilization’s primary source of energy, as sure as day follows night. 

Mark these words."
3464, I love the graffiti art at Giga Berlin!

3467, Indeed
3468," We’ve had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity. iPhone team is obv super smart.

For sure, closing link from space to phone will work best if phone software &amp; hardware adapt to space-based signals vs Starlink purely emulating cell tower."
3469," Note, I am putting a lot of time personally into advancing Tesla service to make it awesome. Hopefully, this is starting to be felt by Tesla owners."
3470," You’re right, we should credit Tesla owners $100 if we change appointments with less than 24 hours notice. Should be reciprocal."
3471, Lot of people still don’t realize Tesla makes uninterruptible power supplies for your whole home (Powerwall)
3472,And remember 💕
3473, This thread brings back a lot of memories
3474, We have since improved it further
3475," The primary solution to a sustainable energy future is solar/wind with batteries for when sun doesn’t shine or wind doesn’t blow, interconnected with conventional high voltage lines. No unknown technology is needed!

Hydro+geothermal+fission will also be non-trivial contributors."
3476," Fusion would be expensive energy, given difficulty of obtaining and transporting source fuel, plus maintaining the reactor. 

Far better to use the Sun – thermonuclear reactor with no need to refuel or service."
3477, 🤔
3478," Only 64 squares, no fog of war, no tech tree, only a few different pieces,no random spawn. Chess is a simple game. I prefer Polytopia."

3501, .@Chrisrock invited me to open for one of his shows. Thanks Chris! I will try not to flounder too much.
3502," Yes, also very important"
3503," Accurate assessment. Raptor design started out using H2, but switched to CH4. Latter is best combo of high efficiency &amp; ease of operation imo.

Delta-v difference between H2 &amp; CH4 is small for most missions, because CH4 tank is much smaller &amp; no insulation is needed."

3569," I would gladly obey their commands, but I can’t tell what they’re saying!"
3570," I do not doubt that. Criticism, public or private, is welcome after we go to wide beta. 

Early beta has many known issues. The reason we release it to a limited number of cars is to discover unknown issues."
3571," No. Let me make something clear: James contacted me directly to be included in *early* beta, which is only ~1000 cars, mostly employees. 

Early beta explicitly has issues or it would be rolled out widely, so publicly criticizing something he had asked for is wrong."

- Starship to orbit
- FSD wide release

Many other things, of course, but those are the 2 giant kahunas. Will require insane work by many super talented people, but, if anyone can do it, they can. 

It is an honor to work with such awesome human beings."
3591,It is the fastest way to get between one downtown and another with known physics (and the Standard Model is proving quiet resilient)!
3592,Would be cool to do a (much simplified) Hyperloop demo tunnel between maybe Austin &amp; San Antonio?
3593,Now tunnels are in active use in Vegas. Try it if you’re in town. Will be expanding to connect all major destinations in Vegas plus airport.
3594,🤣🤣
3595,Funny how there are often simultaneous reactions saying “it’s impossible” and “it was already done 3000 years ago”
3596,👿
3597," Glad it’s working out! Thanks for giving us this tough case to solve. That’s what field testing is all about.

This early version of 10.69 is being extra cautious, so waits for a moderately big gap in traffic to cross. Upcoming releases will do better in heavy traffic."
3598, Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla software/AI team is who really deserves the credit. The talent level at Tesla is incredible.
3599,"Note, you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app"
3600,"After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5th. 

Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept 5th, but delivered later."
3601,"FSD Beta 10.69 started rolling out to Tesla owners last night. This build is a big step forward!

10.69.1 probably end of week with wider release.

1069.2 in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants."
3602," Tesla Autopilot/AI team did great work with 10.69! Some point releases needed for polish, so 10.69.2 should really shine."
3603, 🤔
3604, Worth hearing about Tesla Autopilot software/AI progress

3716, Somehow I have 54 followers
3717," Good summary of the problem. 

If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms.

However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not."

WSJ should be running stories that actually matter to their readers and have solid factual basis, not third-party random hearsay."
3825," WSJ has run so many bs hit pieces on me and Tesla I’ve lost count! It’s embarrassing for them, frankly.

They once wrote an article saying FBI was about to arrest me, so I called FBI to ask what’s up and they said WSJ article was total bs.

3897, About twice as much useful mass to orbit as rest of Earth combined
3898, Absolutely
3899," More accurate word is “propellant”, rather than “fuel”. Starship is ~78% liquid oxygen, ~22% fuel.

Propellant cost is of primary importance for a fully reusable rocket, so reusable rockets want high thrust, as thrust below T/W of 1 is irrelevant."
3900, I use this example a lot
3901," Starlink bandwidth varies a lot, depending on user terminal density &amp; time of day. That’s why the long wait in some areas.

Throughput is roughly linear with total V1 satellites in operation. V2 satellites are at least 5 times better (conservative estimate) than V1."

3924," Some small tubes &amp; wiring need to be nested in a bigger tube for thermal protection, kinda like conduit in a house. 

Engines themselves &amp; booster base are extremely robust. High strength stainless steel is bulletproof to a handgun at ~2.5mm thickness. Booster dome is 4mm."
3925, Electric power for booster &amp; ship is needed even when engines aren’t running &amp; incremental power draw of TVC isn’t too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes.
3926," Enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save over 10 tons, all things considered.

Shrouds are also a risk in that fuel leaks could be contained by the shroud, forming a MOX bomb.

Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this."
3927," All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass, eg shrouds, TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.

Raptors in production now have electric TVC, saving over a ton of hydraulics mass on booster."

3963," Yeah, but too much drama. Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!?

Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69."
3964," I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat &amp; sail into the sunset.

4259, It should be possible to sue law firms for pursuing insane damages claims

When in covered or underground parking lots, car will have to navigate using only inertial measurement, wheel movement &amp; vision, as GPS signal is no longer available."
4327," Remarkable, although, as noted, there are big differences between humans and mice. We can cure a mouse of almost any cancer, but most of those cures don’t work with humans."
4328, We are close to the point where offering something for EU regulators to review makes sense
4329,"Also, FSD Beta 10.12.2 now expanding to 100k cars. 

10.13 smooths out intersection control, especially long lefts, and starts to handle roads with no map data at all. 

Last point is a big deal. Within a few months, FSD should be able to drive to a GPS point with zero map data."

4338,Only thing more remarkable than DOJ not leaking the list is that no one in the media cares. Doesn’t that seem odd?

4364, Good interview
4365, Thanks Mr President!
4366, That is its primary purpose
4367," 70 is currently the age when you receive maximum social security benefits. In other words, that’s when the govt concludes that you can’t hold a job!!"
4368, !!
4369," Open primaries sound like a good way to move candidates to be more centrist.

Term limits help with the gerontocracy problem, but, frankly, there should be a max age beyond which you can’t run (maybe 70?), just like there are min ages for house, senate &amp; president."
4370," Thanks, and also well done to you for advancing electric vehicles!"
4371, No
4372," Once again, Bob nails it.

Yes, I am endorsing a political candidate because he is competent!"
4373,"It is rare for me to endorse political candidates. 

My political leanings are moderate, so neither fully Republican nor Democrat, which I am confident is the case for most Americans.

Executive competence is super underrated in politics – we should care about that a lot more!"

4403, Completely useless pos more like it
4404, And Palmer always forgets to mention that he never wrote a single line of Dogecoin code …
4405," For AI and most things, Python. JavaScript for web stuff. 

For high performance or tight code, C/C++, spiced up with some assembly."
4407, Yeah!
4408," Maybe if they do the opposite, Twitter will be a much better experience – just an idea"
4409, Yes
4410, Checking
4411," My kids wrote better code when they were 12 than the nonsense script Jackson sent me.

Jackson Palmer is a tool."
4412," You falsely claimed ur lame snippet of Python gets rid of bots. Ok buddy, then share it with the world …"

4417," Yes. It’s safe to say that Mackenzie [ahem] Scott is not exactly a big fan of her ex-husband. 

Unfortunately, a lot of others are getting caught in the crossfire."
4418, Feels like a Looney Tunes episode
4419, Yup
4420," I support you, Bob! Some bots are good."
4421," Yeah, although I hesitate to admit that, because there are a lot of people that foam at the mouth if you even mention his name!"
4422," The Democrat vs Republican tribalism among otherwise intelligent people is most distressing.

Demonizing everyone who would vote for an alternate party is not constructive."
4423," True. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil &amp; gas industry.

The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie’s donation to PACs posing as charities."
4424," I would be shocked if I’m *not* being spied on haha. 

My only ask is that anyone spying on me please not affect call quality too much or I can’t hear what’s being said!"
4425," I’m just talking about the mid-term elections in November. Not sure that there is a third party candidate.

It’s rather hard to support a party when prominent members of that party keep attacking me and sidelining Tesla &amp; SpaceX!"

4437," The reason you’re not that funny is because you’re woke. 

Humor relies on an intuitive &amp; often awkward truth being recognized by the audience, but wokism is a lie, which is why nobody laughs."
4438, Less funny than SNL on a bad day. This could make a drunk person sober. Try harder!
4439," Still early stages on that. Getting Starship reliably to orbit, then achieving full &amp; immediate reusability of both stages is by far top priority."
4440," 2029 feels like a pivotal year. I’d be surprised if we don’t have AGI by then. Hopefully, people on Mars too."
4441,👀
4442," Well, if you make something that looks like a meme &amp; someone (not me) crops off your name, so it goes.

Also, this is only a 6/10 meme, so maybe step down from that high horse!

The selfless art of anonymous meme creators is something to be admired."
4443," Yeah, the public has no idea how much Tesla and SpaceX have been attacked/undermined, because we aren’t unionized (yet offer highest pay in industry!) and this administration would rather a company be dead than not unionized"
4444," I couldn’t agree more! There is such a thing as too much sentience for household appliances.

Imagine giving advanced AI to a toilet with an implicit “maximize 💩” utility function, so it engages in deep societal manipulation just to get maximum 💩 haha."
4445," I support free speech, but not any one candidate. In fact, I gave money to &amp; voted for Hillary &amp; then voted for Biden.

However, given unprovoked attacks by leading Democrats against me &amp; a very cold shoulder to Tesla &amp; SpaceX, I intend to vote Republican in November."

4467, Yes

4469," Our video clips are usually shorter than 30 seconds, but the overall point made by James is accurate. 

Tesla is probably labeling more images per week than any other project ever done and our rate of labeling is increasing rapidly."
4470, I suspect that this is because the “algorithm” is not exactly genius vs intentional deboosting by people

4494," He’s fine, I guess. Does seem like he’s spending a lot of time in the hot tub these days.

If he wants to get to orbit, less partying and more work would be advisable."
4495, Long-term potential of Tesla is high

4499," True, they must have a scapegoat"
4500," I do try my hardest to be good and sometimes I fear that untrue negative stories about me may cause others to excuse their bad behavior to their conscience, because they think I’m doing it too, but I’m not!"
4501," I know some of the people you mention and I think they’re good, but for sure not all billionaires are good, since we are dealing with humans after all."

4530, I think this would actually work
4531," Based on past experience, about 12 to 18 months. Companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die, so that they stop consuming resources."
4532, Fair
4533, I’m genuinely curious
4534," Yes, but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.

Also, all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don’t actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!"
4535, That would be awesome
4536," This would be a super bad idea, since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next, eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH!

However, eliminating estate tax dodges like GRATs would be good, since probability of kids being effective stewards of capital is lower."
4537," The degree to which the unions control the Dems is insane. It’s like watching a sock puppet “talk”, but the hand inside the sock is way too obvious!"

4552," How about a middle ground, where the licensing standard for semi-auto rifles is a driver’s license, age 21 and no rap sheet?

4582," That’s a good point. One could simply have a few reference human genomes and simply code each individual with a lossless compression delta!

Could probably fit the DNA sequences of all humans alive today in a fairly small data storage system."
4583, Exactly
4584," Indeed I did. 

However, I also think that Tesla has the potential to be the most valuable company ever. 

When Tesla’s market cap, making sustainable energy products, exceeds that of Aramco, producing fossil fuels, you know the future will be good for Earth."
4585, The Iron Man statue was given to SpaceX because part of Iron Man 2 was filmed in the rocket factory

What is *not* in question is that Sussmann charged the Clinton Campaign for his Russia hoax meeting with the FBI.

4658,Sus man
4659, I am indeed out for blood

Sussmann himself admitted billing Clinton Campaign to pay for him to present Russia hoax to FBI! This is not even questioned by the defense.

4675," No, it was clear that their only goal was a hit price to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. The story was written before they even talked to me."

4968,"But I’m no fan of the far right either. 

Let’s have less hate and more love."
4969,"The far left hates everyone, themselves included!"
4970, 🤣
4971, This is messed up
4972," I try not to pick fights, but I do finish them"
4973," The car knows that something is there, just doesn’t know that they’re horses yet, but it will. Dogs, cats and many other animals will also be recognized."
4974," I strongly supported Obama for President, but today’s Democratic Party has been hijacked by extremists"
4975, No further TSLA sales planned after today
4976,"“Real magic is only a sip away.”
(Actual slogan of Coca-Cola!!) 🤣🤣"
4977,.@CocaCola Oh hi lol
4978, Same
4980, Freedom of speech means freedom of speech
4981, Discomforting
4982, Accurate interview
4983, 🤣🤣
4984, FCC FTW!
4986, Sounds like satire
4987, Great show!
4988, Trumpet is legit a way better name
4989,"Listen, I can’t do miracles ok"
4990,Let’s make Twitter maximum fun!
4991, Kicks Red Bull’s ass!
4992, Some sci-fi that actually features sci-fi would be great
4993,Next I’m buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in
4994,"Twitter DMs should have end to end encryption like Signal, so no one can spy on or hack your messages"
4995, 🤣💫
4996, Vegas Boring Co tunnel
4997, What are talking about? I’m just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.
4998,"For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally"
4999," The Washington Post targets me relentlessly! 

Their insults could be higher quality, but some are not bad. I gave them 3 stars on Yelp."
5000," Almost every media outlet on Earth wrote about me acquiring Twitter, causing a massive influx of new users"
5001," Yeah, I noticed that too. Pretty weird."
5003,Should be called Trumpet instead!
5004,Truth Social (terrible name) exists because Twitter censored free speech
5005, 🤣🤣
5006, 🤣
5007,Truth Social is currently beating Twitter &amp; TikTok on the Apple Store
5008, Sounds pretty bad …
5009, Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate
5010,Per aspera ad astra!
5011,"Raptor 2 rocket engines at Starbase, each producing over half a million pounds (230 tons) of force"
5012,"By “free speech”, I simply mean that which matches the law. 

I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. 

If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.

Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people."
5013,The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all
5014, 🤩
5015, Can someone please give the NPCs a bigger dialogue tree!?
5016,🚀💫♥️ Yesss!!! ♥️💫🚀
5017,"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means"
5018,And be my love in the rain
5019," The Instagram curse: 

Water everywhere, yet always thirsty."
5020, I do love humanity
5021," The San Francisco office of the SEC were shameless puppets of Wall St shortseller sharks, while doing nothing to protect actual shareholders. That is why I lost all respect for them."
5022," The head of Saudi PIF committed unequivocally to take Tesla private with me, as witnessed by the Tesla CFO and several others. That is why I said funding was secured."
5023, Yup
5024," Underground tunnels are immune to surface weather conditions (subways are a good example), so it wouldn’t matter to Hyperloop if a hurricane was raging on the surface. You wouldn’t even notice."
5025," In the coming years, Boring Co will attempt to build a working Hyperloop. 

From a known physics standpoint, this is the fastest possible way of getting from one city center to another for distances less than ~2000 miles. Starship is faster for longer journeys."
5026," Next beta release has many improvements, especially for complex left turns &amp; heavy traffic"
5027, Strange how these things are bucketed. I think of the whole company as being R&amp;D.
5028," First one definitely, second is nice to have and third isn’t needed imo"
5029, Drug naming conventions are so ridiculous! Does someone just literally have a random syllable generator!?
5030, 🤣
5031,(from making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action)
5032, Getting there
5033," Definitely. Might be less than 5 years away, as current version Neuralinks are semi-generalized neural read/write devices with ~1000 electrodes and tinnitus  probably needs &lt;&lt;1000.

Future gen Neuralinks will increase electrode count by many orders of magnitude."
5034," In the meantime, semaglutide (aka Ozempic/Rybelsus) appears to be effective in appetite control with minor side effects"
5035, Yes
5036," Current generation Neuralinks can help to some degree, but an advanced case of Alzheimers often involves macro degeneration of the brain. 

However, Neuralinks should theoretically be able restore almost any functionality lost due *localized* brain damage from stroke or injury."
5037, !
5038," If you’ve engineered or manufactured smart watches or phones, please join Neuralink! Your skills are directly applicable."
5039," It is an electronics/mechanical/software engineering problem for the Neuralink device that is similar in complexity level to smart watches (which are not easy!), plus the surgical robot, which is comparable to state-of-the art CNC machines.

No need for AI/ NN/ML quite yet."
5040,Moving on …
5041," Also, epic printer scene in Office Space"
5043, Your new title at Block is 🔥🔥
5044, Yeah
5045, ESG ratings make no sense
5046," Elden Ring is incredible, but why are extremely gory death/murder scenes ok, but panties get you banned!?"
5047, 🤔
5048, 🤣 also why are there still printers?
5049, Tesla China is doing incredible work
5050,shadow ban council reviewing tweet …
5051,in case u need to lose a boner fast
5052," Yeah, but I didn’t leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends. 

I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it’s not exactly top secret."
5053," FSD is best in Bay Area, given engineering mostly lives there, but rest of country will soon be at that level"
5054, Something like that
5055, Good list
5056, Yes
5057, So many “verified” scam crypto bots!
5058," I will verify you. 

The current process for verification is like if Kafka had a Magic 8-Ball!"
5059, I wish we did. Would be better for making life multiplanetary.
5060,What is best in life?
5061,The Barbarians are at the Gate
5062, The real tragedy is that tie I’m wearing!
5063, That number should probably be on my gravestone at this point
5064, Yes
5065, 🤣💯
5066,Believe in the future
5069, Tesla is really a dozen or more startups if you look at all the things created from scratch that aren’t present in other car companies
5070,And authenticate all real humans
5071, Indeed (heavy sigh)
5072,"If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!"
5073,"Such a joy to work with amazingly talented people at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co!"
5074, Diess deserves a lot of credit for moving VW rapidly towards electrification. They’re lucky to have him.
5075," My true moral error was creating Tesla &amp; SpaceX at same time, while avoiding general mgmt chores at Tesla (focusing only on product &amp; engineering). Tried to have my cake &amp; eat it too, which failed."
5076," Agreed. I wish JB &amp; I had just moved forward to commercialize the Tzero without adding other partners. In the end, that’s what happened anyway."
5077, Resistance is futile
5078, The esthetics of the new rendering will improve
5079, SNL is so rarely funny these day (sigh)
5080, Making rocket reuse normal is the goal
5081, Always look on the bright side of life
5082, Maybe JB would be up for that too. He deserves a lot of credit (as do many longtime Tesla people).
5083, Ok sure
5084, Yes
5085," The failures are mine, the successes belong to others"
5086," I should, but that would take a lot of time away from Tesla, SpaceX &amp; other work. Walter Isaacson is writing a book."
5087, Exactly
5088," I put in all I had, whereas Eberhard, who was worth over $10M at the time, refused to invest a penny to help Tesla. 

If it was really his baby, he would never have stood by while it starved to death.
"
5089," But if he was actually capable of creating a company like Tesla, he would have done so after he was fired for lying outrageously about cost &amp; progress of Roadster in mid 2007.

We would’ve lost at least a few talented people if he was the real deal, but we lost no one."
5090, Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He’s a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years.
5091," They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive &amp; has lots of time on their hands!"
5092," When Eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in July 2007 (for damn good reasons), no one left with him. That says it all."
5093," If filing a shell corp constitutes “founding a company”, then I’d be the only founder of PayPal, since I filed the original incorporation docs for (later renamed PayPal), but that’s not what founding means."
5094," Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees, no IP, no designs, no prototype, literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion’s Tzero car, which was introduced to me by JB Straubel, *not* Eberhard. 

Even name “Tesla Motors” was owned by others!"
5095,"Please consider working at The Boring Company! 

Our goal is to solve traffic, which plagues every major city on Earth."
5096," Hopefully, I didn’t say too many dumb things"
5097, Tesla opex is embarrassingly high imo!
5098, $1T valuation with $0 advertising spend
5099, Does it accurately portray software engineers?
5100, Yeah
5101, Yes
5102, Had to been done
5103,_______ is the Night

5105, True
5106, I love Pinball Wizard!
5107, Absolutely
5108, Yes
5109, The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable
5110,A social media platform’s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy
5111, Extremely concerning. Who is pushing this censorship/deplatforming? Very shadowy.
5112, 🤣
5113, ♥️🚀✨
5114,SpaceX Falcon team making great progress! Aiming for 5 day launch cadence with many performance &amp; refurb improvements.
5115,"Why, thank you, sir! "
5116, 🤣🤣
5117," Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that’s ~$3M/year saved right there"
5118," Since he is consistently wrong, it should be possible to do quite well simply by doing the opposite of what he recommends"
5119, I feel it’s important that one’s hat also have a hat. Long-standing belief.
5120, I used to be such a snappy dresser!
5121, I think my clothes are too big for me
5122," I love it, sign me up"
5123, 🤣
5124, Sounds high
5125, I should probably stop cutting my own hair haha
5126, Good interview
5127, 😜
5128,Happy Easter!
5129,Smooth landing video
5130," Based on feedback received, we will drop mobile connector price to $200 &amp; make it easy to order with car. 

Note, mobile connector is not needed if you have a Tesla wall connector or to use Superchargers.

Recommend installing Tesla wall connector well before car arrives."
5131," In fairness to the Twitter board, this might be more of a concern about other potential bidders vs just me"
5132," Usage statistics were super low, so seemed wasteful. On the (minor) plus side, we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit."
5133, 😛
5134,🎶 Love Me Tender 🎶
5135," Wow, with Jack departing, the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares! Objectively, their economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders."
5136," Civilization, as defined by the invention of writing, is only ~5500 years old"
5137, 🤣🤣
5138, !
5139, Indeed
5140, 🙃
5141, Thanks for teaching me so much about rocket engines!
5142, 🤣
5143, 🤣
5144, My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is *way* overdue for long form tweets!
5145, 🤣
5146,🤔
5147, As I was saying …
5148," 6 seconds, better said as 6000 milliseconds, which is a long time to computers, is about right"
5149,i♥️u
5150," If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty. 

The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale."
5151, Good question
5152, 🧐
5153,"Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board"
5154," Absolutely. It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote. They own the company, not the board of directors."
5155," Interesting. Just two questions, if I may. 

How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly &amp; indirectly?

What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?"
5156,Will endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law
5157,I made an offer 
5158, Great idea
5159, Coming soon
5160, Exciting times ahead
5161, Disconnected from what it takes to make stuff
5162, I’m serious about this one btw
5163, Exactly
5164," Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front &amp; account doesn’t get checkmark for 60 days (watch for CC chargebacks) &amp; suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam"
5165, It should go away or scammers will game the system by signing up only for a few months
5166, Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?
5167," Yes, should be proportionate to affordability &amp; in local currency"
5168, Exactly. It would massively expand the verified pool &amp; make bot armies too expensive to maintain.
5169," You will get it back, even though you shorted Tesla, you bastard 🤣"
5170,Weather is fake. I seen Truman Show!
5171, The resemblance is uncanny
5172," As the saying goes, when the government first prints money, everyone feels like a winner, but in the end no one does"
5173," Fake news purveyors would have hysterics, but a ratings system would improve quality of news greatly"
5174, All of Earth is a tiny dust mote compared to the Sun
5175, Yes
5176, .@Beeple is 🔥🔥
5177,69.420% of statistics are false
5178,Truth is the first casualty.
5179, Yeah
5180, Absolutely
5181, 💯
5182, Now subtract crypto scam accounts that twitter constantly shows as “real” people in everyone’s feed
5183,And only posted once this entire year
5184,"For example, hasn’t posted anything in 3 months"
5185,"Most of these “top” accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. 

Is Twitter dying?"
5186,Interesting
5187, We have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction &amp; refinement
5188, True
5189," Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining &amp; refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.

There is no shortage of the element itself, as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth, but pace of extraction/refinement is slow."
5190, Team did amazing work!
5191, I mean … that’s a lot of hamsters 🐹
5192, Smooth video courtesy of bolting Starlinks to the deck. They are able to handle high vibration &amp; acoustics.

5194, Flight-proven!

Built &amp; delivered first Giga Texas production cars &amp; threw a killer opening party 💥💫 🚘"
5196,Show starts in ~20 mins

5204,I will give a talk around 9
5205,"🇺🇸🇺🇸 Gigafactory Texas 🇺🇸🇺🇸

Grand opening party tomorrow!

Doors open at 4, festivities at 8"
5206, Great games
5207, No sale took place. Initial share number filed was incorrect.
5208, …
5209, Increasingly likely that the Tesla vehicle computer will be able to process 288 FPS (36 Hz * 8 cameras)
5210, 10.12 will significantly improve unprotected left turns
5211," The power used by humans is so tiny compared to how much power from the Sun reaches Earth!

Solar power is ~1GW per sq km. At current solar efficiency, net electrical power is ~200 MW per square km.

The entire United States can be powered by a small corner of Texas."
5212, Yikes
5213, WaPo always good for a laugh 🤣🤣
5214, Thanks Jack!
5215, Looking forward to working with Parag &amp; Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!
5216," Yeah, single most annoying problem on twitter imo"
5217, That sounds reasonable
5218, Facebook gives me the willies
5219, That is harder than a boss battle in DS3!
5220," I mean, if the people vote overwhelmingly for something, it is at least *a* data point!"
5221,Do you want an edit button?
5222, Staggeringly unfunny
5223, First I’ve learned of this. Will be patched shortly.
5224, Yes!
5225, Spain should build a massive solar array. Could power all of Europe.
5226,Oh hi lol
5227,Berlin rocks
5228," Raptor pump power is over 100MW per engine &amp; 33 engines, means over 3GW. Not even remotely possible for electric motors &amp; batteries to compete."
5229," We aim for 30% GM or ~10% profitability, all costs included"
5230, Good summary
5232, George Lucas once told me that the only reason Star Wars got made is because the old studio heads died
5233," Old people don’t change their minds, with rare exception, they just die. Without death, there would not be change."
5234,"I am inspired by curiosity. 

That is what drives me. 

So let us expand the scope &amp; scale of consciousness so that we may aspire to understand the Universe."
5235, There will come a time in the future where people will be surprised that we let practically anyone drive a 2 ton death machine anywhere they want
5236,Peace. Peace?  I hate the word. Those who do care about peace (myself aspirationally included) don’t need to hear it. And those who don’t care about peace? Well …
5238, I look kinda dumb in that pic haha
5239, And Shakespeare had no surviving descendants
5240, I am increasingly convinced that corporate ESG is the Devil Incarnate
5241, He never had even one kid 😞
5242, Seriously. One of them might been Einstein!
5243, Константи́н Циолко́вский
5245,I’m talking about not having kids in the first place. That’s the problem.
5246,But we should
5247,Humanity did not evolve to mourn the unborn
5248, Exactly
5249,They wrote PEACE on the wall at Berghain! I refused enter.
5252, This might be gearing up to be literally the biggest party on Earth
5254," This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions &amp; China zero Covid policy.

Outstanding work by Tesla team &amp; key suppliers saved the day."
5255, Just show her this video explains everything
5256, True
5258, 🤣🤣
5259,To think I grew up 2b bizniz magnet 🤩
5260," Yes, but we take a very cautious approach to safety. As we confirm functionality on Canadian roads, the beta will expand."
5261, Will take of it
5262, You may be in an area that is at maximum capacity. Did SpaceX not provide an unsubscribe warning?
5263, 🤣
5264, Ok
5265, Canada requires charging by the minute vs kWh. We’re working to get that changed.
5266, Will find out. Our aspiration is just to make a modest return vs the fully-considered price of Supercharging.
5267," Good point. SpaceX &amp; Tesla would probably have died, since both narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2008."
5268,Sustainable energy generation from sun &amp; wind is making great progress!
5269," SpaceX will do the right thing for OneWeb, even though they are a competitor"
5270," FSD Beta should be available in Europe for LHD this summer, RHD a few months later. These dates depend on regulatory approval."
5271, I mean we’re basically identical – a few differences maybe …
5272," The UAW stole millions from workers, whereas Tesla has made many workers millionaires (via stock grants). Subtle, but important difference."
5273, UAW slogan – “Fighting for the right to embezzle money from auto workers!”
5274, “Don’t try this at home”

5276," Original Halo &amp; Smash Bros, but thumb joysticks give me the willies"
5277," Some people use meditation or yoga to calm their mind at the end of the day, but video games on hardcore mode work best for me"
5278," I suppose it would be Elden Ring. 

Finished Halo Infinite on legendary, which was not easy for my ancient neurons!

Terminator: Resistance is underrated, although the machines will be *much* better than this &amp; have 360 deg long-range FoV (sigh).

Cyberpunk is brilliant."
5279," Played some &amp; will continue. I use 🐭 &amp; ⌨️, which is suboptimal, but ok with remapping.

Art is incredible, story is good, altho I’m still confused about what’s going on haha. Nonlinear play style &amp; no spoon-feeding are cool."
5280," Haha fine, I probably don’t disagree with you, but even if I did then still!!"
5281," I disagree with you, but I disagree with deleting your stuff even more. That’s what free speech is about."
5282,"Starlink 🛰 team too! Expecting over 4200 Starlink satellites in operation within 18 months, which is ~2/3 of all active satellites of Earth."
5283, Amazing what a zillion tiny cannonballs can do!
5284, Maybe this year isn’t out of the question …
5285, Haha that’s next year
5286,SpaceX Falcon 🚀 team is making excellent progress – aiming for 60 launches this year!
5287,We’ve all been there
5289,"Covid-19 is the virus of Theseus.

How many gene changes before it’s not Covid-19 anymore?

I supposedly have it again (sigh), but almost no symptoms."
5290, The Washington Post’s current slogan is “Democracy Dies in Darkness”. Catchy – for sure – but then what’s up with the paywall for news!?
5291," Ah yes, I see they decided to editorialize. Here’s what I actually said:"
5292, tick tock
5293," I usually drive an alpha build, but switch to beta right before release so I know what Tesla owners are getting"
5294, 🤣
5295,Seize the memes of production!
5296," Toronto streetcars are not yet handled well by FSD. Btw, is on a ~4 month sabbatical."
5297, 🤣
5298, 👍
5299, Funny to think that sapphire is just corroded aluminum!
5300, I just did. Now what?
5301, This is pretty good. 10.12 will have major improvements for tricky unprotected lefts &amp; heavy traffic in general. We’re also making good progress with single stack.
5302, Looking into it
5303, 💯
5304, Am giving serious thought to this
5305, True
5306, Haha that would sickkk
5307, Doesn’t sound very balanced
5308,Is a new platform needed?
5309,"Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. 

What should be done?"
5311, Especially seek negative feedback
5312, As predicted
5313," Starlink, at least so far, has resisted all hacking &amp; jamming attempts"
5314, Sigh
5315, 🤣🤣 especially crypto spam!!
5316, True
5317,The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.
5318," I would gladly follow the directions of the chemtrails masterminds, but I can’t figure out what they’re saying!"
5319,"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.

Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"

5328, You mean email?
5329, 🤣
5330,Twitter algorithm should be open source
5331, The algorithm needs to be open source
5332," I’m worried about de facto bias in “the Twitter algorithm” having a major effect on public discourse. 

How do we know what’s really happening?"
5333, True. And even a 10% reduction in g would make reaching orbit relatively easy.

5338," First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines, as they are much more capable &amp; reliable. 230 ton or ~500k lb thrust at sea level.

We’ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month, then another month to integrate, so hopefully May for orbital flight test."
5339," SpaceX default plan was ~65% of global launch mass to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to ~70%, so not a major change. Those numbers don’t count Starship.

Rough math is ~16 tons * 50 launches = 800 tons. Rest of world is &lt;400 tons (mostly China)."
5340, Makes a huge difference to capital efficiency to localize production within a continent

For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer.

Otherwise, we mostly use C++ &amp; Python."
5535," While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the “hard one”, in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too.

An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Can’t just jam GPUs in the trunk."

6212, 10.6.1 coming in a few days to address a few annoying issues
6213, Looking forward to visiting. I’ve heard it’s awesome.
6214,"A background in “AI” is not needed, just exceptional skill in software or computer design"
6215, Congratulations!
6216, Coming soon. Lot of cool stuff.
6217," Tesla publishes accident statistics quarterly. They are so much better than other vehicles, it is ridiculous."
6218,"As always, Tesla is looking for hardcore AI engineers who care about solving problems that directly affect people’s lives in a major way."
6219, Good summary
6220, He is quite a bossy dog :)
6221, NFTs are jpeging the dollar

6223, Landing on tower arms
6224, My car is currently orbiting Mars
6225, You betcha
6226,Starships to ♥️ Mars ♥️
6227,We will soon make these real
6229, Haha pretty much
6230, Exactly
6231, It is an honor to serve NASA and the countries of the International Space Station
6232," 39A is hallowed spaceflight ground – no place more deserving of a Starship launch pad!

Will have similar, but improved, ground systems &amp; tower to Starbase."
6233, Huge cranes are cool haha
6234, I love Norway! 🇳🇴 ♥️🇳🇴
6235, Yes
6236," It releases internally today, then rolls out to external beta in a few days if no significant issues are found"
6237, But yes
6238, Product roadmap update on next earnings call
6239, Yes
6240," Will have both front &amp; rear wheel steer, so not just like a tank – it can drive diagonally like a crab"
6241, “Insane technology bandwagon”
6242," Initial production will be 4 motor variant, with independent, ultra fast response torque control of each wheel"
6243, Is that a line graph in your pocket or just happy to see me?
6244,Construction of Starship orbital launch pad at the Cape has begun

6256, Starship will enable a quantum leap in deep space &amp; planetary science
6257, Exactly
6259,Doesn’t even need maintenance – just works!
6260,"The sun is absurdly, overwhelmingly the source of energy in our solar system"
6261," No, but you could get pretty far with rings of separately orbiting objects, like our solar system’s asteroid belt"
6262," And the sun is technically green, as measured by peak photon count"
6263, But lower power density than a human
6264,Friends &amp; pools are great
6265, Yikes
6266,"Don’t waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!"
6267,Blow the whistle on Tesla!

6269," The magnitude of the Starship program is not widely appreciated. It is designed to extend life to Mars (and the moon), which requires ~1000 times more payload to orbit than all current Earth rockets combined."
6270, Yes
6271," If a severe global recession were to dry up capital availability / liquidity while SpaceX was losing billions on Starlink &amp; Starship, then bankruptcy, while still unlikely, is not impossible.

GM &amp; Chrysler went BK last recession.

“Only the paranoid survive.” – Grove"
6272," The overarching problem is that we need better mental firewalls for the information constantly coming at us. 

Critical &amp; first principles thinking should be a required course in middle school.

Who wrote the software running in your head? Are you sure you actually want it there?"
6273, It’s getting fixed
6274, Suits will need to be made in high volume at an affordable cost &amp; be much easier to use
6275," We had to shift some Starlink satellite orbits to reduce probability of collision. Not great, but not terrible either.

Station &amp; Dragon have micrometeorite shields (ultra high velocity impact absorption), but EVA suits do not, hence higher risk for spacewalk."
6276," 49 years later, games are photo-realistic 3D worlds. What does that trend continuing imply about our reality?"

6281," Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare &amp; it’s not over!

I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call."
6282, Cybertruck will reach far into a post-apocalyptic future &amp; bring that technology to now
6283, Cybertruck is intentionally an insane technology bandwagon
6284, Variable gain (steer by wire) yoke would be ideal …
6285," Acid test for new interface is use it for 2 weeks &amp; see if you still want old version. After using yoke for few weeks, I didn’t want wheel."
6286, Yoke allows unobstructed view of the screen

6293, Yeah
6294," Hypothetically, if they did make lots of electric cars, then they would be the leader"
6295, Exactly
6296, Good thread
6297, Figuratively &amp; literally
6298, Yup
6299," We learned our lesson with $465M DoE loan received in 2010/2011 – onerous terms exceed value of money received. That’s why we paid it back so early, despite an early repayment penalty."
6300, Maybe drive an upright Falcon 9 past the White House flying a giant Stars &amp; Stripes with a marching band playing “I can see clearly now”?
6301, That’s our initial interstage design that we scrapped
6302," Combined Tesla+SpaceX market cap is now over $1.2T, which means “$4.9B” is less than 0.4% of combined company value"
6303," Great speech, couldn’t agree more!"
6304," Great, hope yours is too!"
6305, Haha true
6306, Absolutely!

6316, Such miracles are beyond us
6317," If we are able to make life self-sustaining on Mars, we will have passed one of the greatest filters. That then sets us up to become interstellar.

Earth is ~4.5B years old, but life is still not multiplanetary and it is extremely uncertain how much time is left to become so."
6319, 🤣
6320," Earth has been and will be smashed super hard by meteors over time. Not a question of if, just when."
6321," In 1992, comet Shoemaker-Levy smashed a hole in Jupiter the size of Earth"
6322," This will be really important one day. 

Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth, but there were far more that “merely” destroyed a continent. 

Comets (not asteroids) are the real wild card, as we’re only able to track ~4600 out of  ~1 trillion."
6323,About to launch asteroid defense test!
6324, That is the great question
6325, Exactly
6326, 💯
6327, Exactly (sigh)
6328, Sounds good
6329," It can simulate anywhere, but we need to focus on one region until FSD is out of beta, then expand geographically to have betas in other countries. Canada is not a lot different from US, but different enough."
6330," High-performance code is in C using our own compiler to maximize frame rate. We use Python with custom libraries for fast prototyping, then convert to C for fast execution.

New software is run against real-world video &amp; our world simulator to evaluate performance, then QA."
6331," I don’t use Binance (tried at one point, but signup was too many hoops to jump through), so no inconvenience to me personally. Just raising this issue on behalf of other Doge holders."
6332," Our NNs didn’t have any temporal &amp; spatial memory or surround video auto-labeling back then – everything was knitted together in C++ from single frames with manual labeling.

Still much to improve."
6333, Doge holders using Binance should be protected from errors that are not their fault
6334, Wisdom
6335," Hey, what’s going on with your Doge customers? Sounds shady."
6336, I was able to do several zero takeover drives around Austin last night using random map pin drops (no Tesla has ever done these routes)
6337, Yes
6338," Hell of a rocket! Probably would have succeeded if Korolev had not died. Hopefully, Starship is more fortunate."
6339, 🔥🤣
6340," And all Model S &amp; X production for the world is still done in America, but who’s counting"
6341, Giga Texas is epic
6342, Ancient times …
6343, True
6344, And I will talk to their manager!
6345, The sheer physicality of changes in the brain during sleep or with serious neurodegenerative diseases is much higher than people realize
6346, We do need to have the Fallout-themed party! Aiming to do that once international travel restrictions are lifted.
6347," Meant to say county (sigh). Airport will be part of it, but required additional federal approvals."
6348, Transforming America!
6349," It’s either traffic forever or tunnels. Try our first operational tunnel in Vegas at the convention center! The city just approved a full tunnel network, connecting major hotels, convention center &amp; airport."
6350, Interesting eyes too
6351," Long-term, ship would land on tower arms, like booster"
6352, Unlikely for early ships to splashdown intact. Getting to orbit at all on first try would be a major win.
6353, 🤣
6354, Serious allegations deserve serious responses 🧐
6355, Probably around March
6356, 🤣
6357,It gives me solace
6358,At least 50% of my tweets were made on a porcelain throne
6359,Model S Plaid is sickkkk!!!!

6361,I aspire to comedy
6362, Let’s see if we can get them to say the word “Tesla”!
6363, King of the who!?
6364, Maybe they are NPCs and Tesla just isn’t in their dialogue tree?
6365, Or perhaps some cheese 🧀
6366," The IRS already has dedicated audit teams for high net worth individuals. 

The doubling of staff is for everyone else."
6367," I bounce around WSJ, NYT, BBC, Bloomberg, WaPo &amp; twitter generally. 

Better to follow individual journalists than publications, as there is a wide range of quality."
6368, I like the new direction CNN is going tho
6369, Interesting
6371," We are on the wrong planet for SSTO. On Mars, it is thankfully easy."
6372," If Earth’s gravity was even 10% lower, I’d be all for single stage to orbit"
6373, Yup
6374," Unfortunately, there is just no way to make a motorcycle safe. Motorcyclist deaths per mile are ~29 times higher than car occupants."

6385, Checking …
6387, Hopefully tomorrow
6388, Fractured but whole
6389," .@NASAWatch Keith, is this about right?"
6390," Tragically, it is not clear that the defense contractors can get to the moon for any amount of money. 

More than $200B has been spent on development of new US crewed space transport systems over past ~40 years, but only Dragon is flying. Development cost to NASA was &lt;$2B."
6391, 🤣👍
6392, It’s good to be open about ur vulnerabilities

6394, I suspect that article was written before the drive even took place
6395,Don’t want to brag but … I’m the best at humility
6396," There were no EV incentives (nor did we expect them) &amp; gasoline was super cheap, so tough to make the case for electric cars. 

My guess was that we had &lt;10% chance of success &amp; most people thought 0%. The history car startups is just one big graveyard."

6418, It does need people!
6419," Accept worst case outcome &amp; assign it a probability, which is usually very low. Now think of good things in life &amp; assign them probabilities – many are certain!

Bringing anxiety/fear to the conscious mind saps it of limbic emotional strength.

Cheery fatalism is very effective."
6420," Limiting factor for first launch is regulatory approval. Thereafter, fundamental issue is solving engine production.

Prototypes are easy, production is hard."
6421," True, although it will look clean with close out panels installed. 

Raptor 2 has significant improvements in every way, but a complete design overhaul is necessary for the engine that can actually make life multiplanetary. It won’t be called Raptor."

6431, Exactly
6432," Yes, that is the other major source of dilution. All employees receive stock after a year at Tesla and we now have over 100,000 employees worldwide."
6433, That loophole does seem questionable
6434," I had majority control for the first 5 years or so of Tesla, but car companies need lots of capital, so now I’m around 20% or so, despite putting in as much as I could along the way"
6435," Agreed, taxes are best applied to (especially extravagant) consumption, whereas capital allocation taxes reduce goods &amp; services output, so actually bad for the people.

Probable capital allocation skill of heirs is lower than original creator, so I am in favor of an estate tax."

6461," Inter-satellite laser communications means Starlink can carry data at speed of light in vacuum all around Earth before touching ground.

Over time, some amount of communication can simply be from one user terminal to another without touching the Internet."
6463, It is a very impressive history
6464," Once the board was presented with the evidence of Eberhard’s deception/fraud &amp; the dire state of the company, all board members, including those he appointed, voted unanimously to fire him in August 2007."
6465," He came damn close to killing Tesla through a combination of bad management decisions, driving out talented people, bad engineering, major blunders in supply chain &amp; an elaborate deception about the true cost &amp; schedule of the Tesla Roadster."
6466," Founding story of Tesla as portrayed by Eberhard is patently false. I wish I had never met him.

Eberhard is by far the worst person I’ve ever worked with in my entire career. Given how many people I’ve worked with over the years, that’s really saying something …"
6467, Good static fire with all six engines!
6468," No guarantees, but maybe next month. Requires quite a lot of incremental testing &amp; code tweaks for different road system in Canada."

6470, Ancient times
6471," I hope they’re able to achieve high production &amp; breakeven cash flow. That is the true test. 

There have been hundreds of automotive startups, both electric &amp; combustion, but Tesla is only American carmaker to reach high volume production &amp; positive cash flow in past 100 years."

6593," GM &amp; Chrysler were bailed out (money never repaid), but Tesla was not.

Crucial Tesla investment actually came from Daimler in 2009, from which they did very well.

Tesla received govt energy efficiency loan in 2010, by which time capital markets reopened. Loan was repaid early."
6594, My plan is to use the money to get humanity to Mars and preserve the light of consciousness
6595," US Federal Debt/GDP was 56% in 2000, now it is 126% &amp; climbing fast"
6596, 🤣
6597," US national debt is ~$28,900 billion or ~$229k per taxpayer.

Even taxing all “billionaires” at 100% would only make a small dent in that number, so obviously the rest must come from the general public. This is basic math.

Spending is the real problem.
"
6598, You can also talk through the car speaker. Great for practical jokes :)
6599," Tentative plan is 98 &amp; above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week.

If we see any concerns, uploads will pause while we investigate, so might take a few days before everyone with 98 safety gets beta 10.4.

10.4 improves left turns across fast traffic &amp; stopping for gates."
6600," FSD/AI team is doing great work. Will get superhuman good in upcoming releases. 

Note, we will slow down upload rate of releases going forward. First from QA fleet to employee cars for a day, then slowly releasing at ~1000 cars/hr to external beta on Friday aft."
6601, 💯
6602," That math is incorrect, but still a lot of devices per second! 

I guess if Tesla can reach 20M cars/year, that would be one every ~1.5 seconds!"
6603," According to their own estimates, this tax only covers ~10% of the $3.5 trillion spending bill. 

Where will the other 90% come from? 

The answer is you."
6604," Wow, 13 years ago"
6605, I feel like this has happened at Tesla a few times
6606, I kinda like avocado toast &amp; pro level coffee tbh :) Starbase cuisine does an amazing job with those.
6607, Another way of saying we’re in a simulation
6608," Reducing traffic fatalities by 90% seems likely, perhaps ultimately by over 99%"
6609," Also, Tesla will soon be a German car manufacturer."
6610," German car manufacturers will rebound strongly. They possess great talent, which will not sit idle."
6611, But the Bee nails it again 🤣🤣
6612," Who is best at capital allocation – government or entrepreneurs – is indeed what it comes down to. 

The tricksters will conflate capital allocation with consumption."
6613, Thanks 😎
6614, Truth is stranger than fiction
6615," To be clear, cars sold to Hertz have no discount. Same price as to consumers."
6616," I don’t know about long-term, but short-term we are seeing strong inflationary pressure"
6617," Exactly. Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you."
6618, I’d like to express appreciation to Tesla Autopilot engineering &amp; QA for working round the clock all weekend to resolve the problem
6619," Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD. 

Our internal QA fleet didn’t see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward."
6620," Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem"
6621,Wild $T1mes!
6622," Indeed, this is intended to be useful advice, based on my extremely painful experience, not an attack in any way"
6623," Prototypes are trivial compared to scaling production &amp; supply chain. If those are solved, achieving positive gross margin is the next nightmare. 

Starting a second new vehicle line before first is working will divide resources &amp; amplify probability of failure."
6624, That feature is coming
6625,10.3.1 rolling out now

6635,Pop music has both literal &amp; figurative Stockholm Syndrome
6636, Wasn’t easy
6637, Lots of people I talked to on the production lines at Tesla or building rockets at SpaceX own Doge. They aren’t financial experts or Silicon Valley technologists. That’s why I decided to support Doge – it felt like the people’s crypto.
6638,"Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. 

Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta."
6639," Out of curiosity, I acquired some ascii hash strings called “Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; Doge”. That’s it. 

As I’ve said before, don’t bet the farm on crypto! True value is building products &amp; providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form."
6640, 💯
6641, None
6642," Possibly. Bitcoin was conceived at a time of relatively low bandwidth &amp; high latency. If both continue to improve substantially, we will reach a point when no second layer is needed."
6643, We’re working on this issue right now
6644," Not recently. What matters imo is lowering fees, decreasing block time &amp; increasing block size. A single layer network with exchanges as de facto layer 2 seems like the simplest solution for a medium of exchange."
6645, As requested
6646," Got to 321 bar before RUD, but cause may be due to oxygen inlet pressure too low, rather than engine issues"
6647, We live in a gerontocracy
6648, Plus crypto scams haha
6649," Neither Jared, nor me, nor anyone I know has anything to do with this foundation"
6650,Your support makes a big difference! Please let the FAA know your opinion.
6651, Yes
6652,"Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in 10.3. Fix in work, probably releasing tomorrow."

6661, Can I retweet this in cropped form?
6662, Tries to launch some rockets – accidentally summons dark lord
6663, It’s gonna be great!
6664, Exactly
6665, Shaking out the problems (literally) haha
6666," Yeah, although early production cars will need camera upgrades, as well as FSD computer (all included in the price)"
6667," No, we expect some tiles to shake loose during static fires"
6668, Hopefully
6669," Currently at ~270 bar, but working on upgrades to get it over 300 bar"
6670," Raptor has a very high chamber pressure, which in turn allows for a large expansion ratio nozzle without flow separation at sea level"
6671, This will be cool
6672, Beat the 🐌!
6673, We are
6674, Noooo
6675, 🤣
6677, Very soon
6678," Yeah, when we’re out of beta"
6679, Most likely
6680, Absolutely
6681," Well-said, Dr Aldrin!"
6682, Yup
6683, Well-optimized Starship would do ~250 tons to orbit as expendable &amp; ~150 tons fully reusable
6684, Nods
6685, The day FSD goes to wide release will be one of the biggest asset value increases in history
6686, Full &amp; rapid reusability is the holy grail of orbital rocketry
6687, Most big companies in tech have turned into places where talent goes to die

6705, Autonomy must &amp; will work even with no connectivity
6706," We can do that partially, but detailed rocket technology is considered advanced weaponry (same tech as nuclear missiles), so there are more limitations than at Tesla"
6707, Yeah
6708, 👆
6709, Maybe Buffett should invest in Tesla haha
6710,"Thanks Cameron County, Brownsville &amp; South Padre for your support! Much appreciated."
6711, Thanks!!

6713, 🤣
6714," We already have a giant, free fusion reactor in the sky called the sun. Just catch it’s energy with PV, store in battery &amp; you’re pretty much done."
6715, Correct
6716, Technical details will be in release notes
6717,Beta 10.3 releasing Friday next week to all cars with 99/100 safety score
6718, Pretty much :)
6719, Fan art is the best
6720, LASIK has improved so many people’s lives!
6721, Great game
6722, Haha
6723," Congrats, was cool to send to space"
6724, If it possible to start an EV company without shipping any cars &amp; get a valuation less than a billion dollars!?
6725," I hope they have a high pain tolerance. Scaling production, supply chain, logistics &amp; service is a world of hurt."
6726, 🤣
6727," Yes, we are talking to airlines about installing Starlink. Please let them know if you want it on your airliner. 

Low latency ~half gigabit connectivity in the air!"
6728, These are strange days
6729, They will

6738, Godspeed Captain
6739, “Lasers”
6740, Maybe next week. We’d like to get to 10.3 before expanding the beta.
6741, Always
6742, 😜
6743," Agreed. Trying to get all the approvals needed to offer insurance is extremely difficult, but it’s coming."
6744," Production, supply chain &amp; logistics are so hard!"
6745, Yeah
6746," But they should go electric now. Less range, but so easy, quiet &amp; clean."
6747," Yeah, on its way (sigh)"

6751, Starship is a hard problem
6752, Not to mention warm-up latency
6753," Vision became so good that radar actually reduced SNR, so radar was turned off. 

Humans drive with eyes &amp; biological neural nets, so makes sense that cameras &amp; silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving."
6754, 🤣
6755," Just want to emphasize this is the work of hundreds of awesome engineers in both software &amp; hardware, over 1000 data analysts &amp; billions of owner miles"
6756," Low occlusion gates are challenging, but should be fixed soon"
6757,Beta 10.2 now rolling out to cars with 100/100 safety score over 100 miles
6758, It will be available in perforated rolls
6759," [puff, puff] what if the cure for cancer

6762, Thanks for playing Giga Berlin!
6763, 🥈
6764," I love ALW! Couldn’t agree more. My dog Marvin is Havanese too, although I’m *his* emotional support human."
6765, Team is in fact working hard! They just confirmed 10.2 is good to go tomorrow night.
6766, It’s true
6767, Hell yeah
6768, Sure hope so!
6769, Physics ftw
6770," These are nice, but high time we built a really big Tesla coil!"
6771," Cells &amp; FSD are massive, the rest is just beauty &amp; romance … but life is empty without those last two"
6772," Yeah, headlights are precision LED, so they can be bright without blinding oncoming traffic, pedestrians &amp; cyclists"
6773," It will hopefully achieve sustained cycle time of 45 seconds. At 75% uptime over an average week, that’s ~10k/week if run 24/7."
6774, Sunday/Monday
6775, Das klingt nach “Space Party”
6776,A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.
6777,Giga Berlin-Brandenburg Spaß-Party heute!
6778, There are many small joys as you explore the car &amp; more to come via software updates
6779, So crazy to have come this far!
6780, Exactly
6781,"If you’d like to join Tesla AI, but can’t easily move to Palo Alto or Austin, that is acceptable for extremely excellent candidates where inefficiency of distance is overcome by talent"
6782,Sorry if we’ve been too dumb to respond to you. Please cite evidence of exceptional ability in a few bullet points. Nothing else matters.
6783,Please consider joining Tesla AI software or hardware teams!
6784," I’m so dying to do a supersonic, electric VOTL jet, but adding more work will make my 🧠 🧨"
6785,"Starlink is designed for low to medium population density, which means we can hit max users in some areas fast. 

Please sign up early to ensure a spot. As more satellites roll out, SpaceX will be able to serve more. 
"
6786," Should be nationwide rollout by end of month. Note, still limited by peak number of users in same area. 

This will improve as more satellites are launched."
6787, Haha true
6788, Definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. Exciting actuarial problem!
6789, Sure
6790," It’s a big deal that Dragon is reusable, with improved refurbishment efficiency with each passing flight! This is not the case for other orbital spacecraft.

It means the spacefleet grows every time a new Dragon is made."
6791," Long list of mostly little items, but driving experience is significantly better. We will put notable changes in the release notes."
6792, Everyone with a perfect score with get it. There are ~1000 owners with perfect scores. Maybe 1100 to 1200 by Friday night.
6793," Note, quality of experience can vary dramatically, as our neural nets have far more training data in some parts of the country than others, but this should improve rapidly with more driving in those regions."
6794, Yes
6795, Try explaining it to a 17-month-old – that’s hard!
6796,"FSD Beta 10.2 rolls out Friday midnight to ~1000 owners with perfect 100/100 safety scores. 

Rollouts will hold for several days after that to see how it goes. 

If that looks good, beta will gradually begin rolling out to 99 scores &amp; below."
6797, 🤣🤣
6798, Tesla always pays its debts

6833, We aim to do the most for the least $
6834,"Apologies, 10.2 release will be a week from Friday"
6835," First few days probably 100/100, then 99, 98, etc."
6836,"Wow, lot of interest in FSD beta! Plan is to roll out version 10.2 midnight Friday, then on-ramp ~1000 owners/day, prioritized by safety rating."
6837," If tiles are not super thin, you get hot plasma “waterfalling” off edges of tiles, creating hotspots. 

That said, I’m not entirely convinced that this couldn’t be done with several overlapping scales of metal sheet with an insulator between scale armor &amp; primary structure."

6853," And booster used to be 70m, but this required an awkward half barrel width of steel, so now it’s 69m"
6854, Haha so true of rocket engine development
6856, Very much a beta calculation. It will evolve over time to more accurately predict crash probability.
6857, Yes
6858,"FSD Beta request button goes live tonight, but FSD 10.1 needs another 24 hours of testing, so out tomorrow night"
6859," Chris was an early employee of SpaceX, and made a significant contribution, but was not a cofounder"
6862, Maybe reality is a Rick &amp; Morty episode
6863, I didn’t think so at the time
6864, So pointy!
6865, Super important for Doge fees to drop to make things like buying movie tix viable
6866, Giga Berlin will help a lot
6867, That would break the NASA budget!
6868, Birth rate collapse is the biggest threat to human civilization
6869, We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.
6870, Logistics is underrated
6871," Exactly. Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter, then cars for far away parts of China, then cars for nearby parts of China. 

Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team, so we’re hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 &amp; Q1."
6872, Great view of Earth!
6873, Tesla is the king of car farts!
6874," Hopefully worldwide long-term, but insurance is a regulatory labyrinth/escape room!"
6875," The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow &amp; complex, varying considerably by state. 

Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month.

Probably next year before we get approval in New York."
6876," Good point, we could enable visualization before control. Will enable that option hopefully next month."
6877, Definitely upgraded toilets :) We had some challenges with it this flight.
6878," Not super surprising, given that internal combustion engine cars literally have “combustion” in the name"
6879," Yeah, a little oven for heating food &amp; Starlink wifi"
6880,Just met with the crew in Florida to congratulate them in person. Such great people!
6881, Tesla has not yet decided on a fourth Gigafactory location
6882," To be precise, completely &amp; immediately reusable orbital rockets are the fundamental breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary"
6883, Which games did they like most?
6884, Nice work!
6885, Good
6886," No, has to be turned on by car owner"
6887, Yes
6888, Tesla insurance calculator will show status in real-time &amp; tell you what actions are needed to be rated “good driver”
6889, 7 days after approval to log driving style
6890, Not a tiny engine
6891," Remarkable how few people realize this capability exists. Many think it is 5 years away! With public beta rollout in coming weeks, awareness should improve dramatically."
6892, Seems that way
6893," Looks fine. Take 2 aspirin, call me in the morning."
6894, Some amount of cooperation would be good
6895, Absolutely

6902, One of my favorite movies
6903," Yes

No, but it will get refilled &amp; maybe cargo transfer"
6904," Making life multiplanetary is an extremely hard, but not impossible, problem"
6905, Still basically nothing compared to the orbital mass flux needed for a base on moon or Mars
6906," Probably will trap a Tesla with the production Autopilot build, but won’t work with FSD. Using a ring of cones would stop FSD though."
6907, It will be there
6908, Sigh
6909," Long chain hydrocarbons, like kerosene, have excellent volumetric energy density, but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen, which is CH4. 

Also, easy to make &amp; store CH4+O2 from CO2+H2O, which are abundant on Mars."
6910, ♥️ 🌍 🌎 🌏 ♥️
6911," Fully reusable rockets want high T/W to minimize $/ton to orbit, because propellant cost actually matters"
6912, Automatically drive to most obvious location unless occupant says otherwise
6913," With that, Ship is basically begging for an extra 3 engines"
6914, 33
6915, Exactly

6917, Throw in some hydrogen &amp; lithium for a real party
6918, 🔥
6919, What propellant?
6920,"Moving at ~23 times speed of sound, circling Earth every ~90 minutes"
6921," Ironically, yes at this time. FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isn’t necessary, but it is. Also, any beta user who isn’t super careful will get booted. 

2000 beta users operating for almost a year with no accidents. Needs to stay that way."
6922," Yeah. We’d use our Ka parabolics or laser links for Dragon, Starship or other spacecraft as soon as they got above cloud level."
6923, Jay is right
6924,"Please add your voice to the public comments. Support is greatly appreciated! 

Humanity’s future on the moon, Mars &amp; beyond depends upon it.

6925," The lesson from “tortoise &amp; hare” is not that tortoises are faster, but rather that hares should not be complacent"
6926, September will be interesting
6927," Technology probably ready in a few months, thereafter limited by regulatory approval"
6928," Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted."
6929, Yes
6930, Next month
6931,"Good feedback from FSD Beta 10 users! 10.0.1 point release rolling out now. 

10.1 rolls out a week from Friday with beta request button."
6932, Truth is stranger than fiction
6933, Congratulations on a successful mission!
6934," RIP, Sir Sinclair. I loved that computer."
6935,Just spoke with crew. All is well.
6936, Missions like Inspiration4 help advance spaceflight to enable ultimately anyone to go to orbit &amp; beyond
6937, That’s my safe word too
6938, Maneuverability is important for safety
6939, Thanks Richard!
6940, Thank you
6941, It was an honor to wish you Godspeed before you left for orbit!
6942,Watch Countdown on Netflix about Inspiration4 mission launching today
6943," It is hard to overstate criticality of reusable rockets. No less important than reusable aircraft, cars or bicycles.

Essential for humanity to become a multiplanet species &amp; backup the biosphere."

6961, Literally!
6962, Forward flaps will change a lot in upcoming versions of Starship – smaller &amp; more leeward
6963," This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers. "
6964," Falcon 9 is technically a heavy lift rocket. If flown as an expendable, payload to orbit is similar to Delta IV Heavy (~25 tons to LEO).

And Starship is ~10 times bigger."
6965, Nice drive
6966, 🤣
6967," With 10.1, it will creep forward with more confidence &amp; quickly reverse back a little (just as a person would) if it sees danger"
6968, Think of Beta 10 as enabling a significantly higher local maximum than Beta 9
6969," To be fair, investors are giving us significant credit for achieving self-driving, given that Tesla’s valuation/production is very high compared to other automakers"

6973, Please challenge Tim of Apple to trial by combat 🙏
6974, Didn’t you sorta win?
6975," Highway stack is still production version, as it is more polished than FSD for now. Single stack for all should release in 10.1."
6976," These are V1.5 Starlinks with laser inter-satellite links, which are needed for high latitudes &amp; mid ocean coverage"
6977, An early season episode of the Tesla soap opera!
6978," Great work by Tesla team, with special thanks to Tesla Automation in Prüm, who were critical to many high-performance parts of Plaid!"
6980, Exactly. Getting paid by the government to launch payloads at much lower prices than competitors is not “government support”.

6987," Tesla doesn’t have the bandwidth to do it, but there are some good third party mod shops"
6988,"Next will be modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop)"
6989,"Tesla Model S Plaid just set official world speed record for a production electric car at Nurburgring. Completely unmodified, directly from factory."
6990," Maybe not, but it’s 99% dot products"
6991, The build I’m driving right now is almost there. FSD 10 will blow your mind.
6992," Expansion will be gradual, based on ensuring maximum safety"
6993, Am I a yoke to you? 😢
6994, Yet another round wheel is boring &amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.
6995, Just messin with ya haha
6996, Are you the same today as you were yesterday?
6997, It seems to be working …
7000, Cybertruck is not like the others
7001, That sums it up well!

7006, Worth it
7007, Many times
7008, That’s one of my tests!
7009, I’m not always late haha
7010," Large incumbent carmakers sell their cars at low to zero true margin. Most of their profit is selling replacement parts to their fleet, of which 70% to 80% are past warranty. 

Like razors &amp; blades.

New car companies lack this advantage. Also lack sales &amp; service infrastructure."
7011, Production is hard. Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard.
7012, Lot of good work happening on Tesla sound codec &amp; audio software in general. Aiming for maximum music dopamine in your brain!
7013, Yes
7014, 2022
7015, A lot has happened in the past 8 years
7016," This is obv debatable, but I’d call anything with ~300 miles / ~500 km of true usable travel distance “long range”, beyond that “very long range”"
7017," There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. 

For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.

Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft."
7018, Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance
7019," Yes. 

Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.

Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.

Pretty basic."
7020,Time is the ultimate currency
7021," Iron, the last element made in a star, appears likely to exceed nickel by 3:1 or more"
7022," Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use."
7023, And Beta 10 is a step change improvement from what you have!
7024, 🤣🤣 “I’m fkn tryin”
7025," Ur welcome, pls be nice to the humans"
7026, Smoked ham
7027," Good progress. Applying information theory to currency (which is just information), lower fees reduce noise &amp; faster &amp; more consistent sync time improve latency &amp; jitter."
7028," The robots are coming anyway, as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show. 

I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe, but I can try my best to do so at Tesla."
7029," In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics."
7030," Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber &amp; shorter path. 

Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!"
7032," Not sure, but maybe a few months. In general for any region, we need to make software work well, test it extensively &amp; then get regulatory approval. If we could go faster while being safe, we would!"
7033, Yes
7034, What is love?
7035,FSD Beta 10 rolls out midnight Friday next week
7036, 🤣🤣
7037, 🚬
7038," I was in the Berlin paint shop talking to the team on my last visit. It’s gonna be great! 

But bear in mind that it takes about a year for a new factory to reach volume production. Production is super hard work, which is why I have great respect for those who do it."

7040, Norway FTW 🇳🇴 💕
7041, Our new crane!
7042, Great shots by
7043, Maybe zap him on the head with our space lasers …
7044," Technically, data packets do not need to touch regular Internet – data can flow from user terminal to satellite/s to user terminal"
7045," Our satellites launching in next few months have inter-satellite laser links, so no local downlink needed. Probably active in 4 to 6 months."
7046, Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job
7047," He should consider spending some money on actual lunar lander hardware, instead of shady lobbyists"
7048, Yup

7065,Stage Zero
7066, Tank treads on the arms
7067," Booster has 2 pins for lifting &amp; catching, although maybe it’s better to modify grid fins to take more load. 

Something will need to flip out from leeward side of top of ship to do same there. Maybe it’s part of fwd flaps, but prob not.

Diff solutions for diff load paths."

7084," Don’t want to be unreasonable, but maybe they should be required to deliver at least one vehicle per billion dollars of valuation *before* the IPO?"
7085, Sure
7086, Good point
7087, Pretty much
7088, Yes
7089, 😔
7090," Good point. We do have torque reduction if an obstacle is detected, but active braking would be better. Prime directive is: do not crash."
7091, Impressive render. Warts &amp; all! New version of Raptor is much cleaner.
7092, 🤣🤣
7093, Turns out Besos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …
7094," Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel &amp; iron.

I’d personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100%, whereas nickel prefers ~90%."
7095, 2 weeks
7096," This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor"
7097, Beta 10 will be next-level

7099, Tesla China rocks!
7100, Nice
7101," We should be there with Beta 10, which goes out a week from Friday (no point release this week). 

It will have a completely retrained NN, so will need another few weeks after that for tuning &amp; bug fixes. Best guess is public beta button in ~4 weeks."

7133," We have almost all the pieces needed for humanoid robots, since we already make robots with wheels"
7134,On now
7135, Will make a big difference
7136," No, bottom static aero pushes engine section back, counteracting Starship’s low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section. 

Aiming for 60 to 70 deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Don’t want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma."
7137, Low center of mass. Bit like our ship &amp; booster on reentry.
7138, Same
7139, 🤣🤣
7140, 🤣
7141," Probably slightly further forward, smaller, more inward. No funny looking static aero at top, as static aero no longer directly in flow."
7142," Btw, there’s a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards. 

New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward &amp; further forward to improve moment arm. Maybe ~120 deg apart."
7143, Product ideas!
7144, True
7145, You can make anything fly haha
7146, Yes
7147, Impressive
7148, Robyn is great
7149," Beta 10 or maybe 10.1. Going to pure vision set us back initially. Vision plus (coarse) radar had us trapped in a local maximum, like a level cap.

Pure vision requires fairly advanced real-world AI, but that’s how our whole road system is designed to work: NN’s with vision."
7150," 9.3, probably 9.4 &amp; then maybe 10. Significant architecture changes in 10."
7151, Improvements in 9.2:
7152, Some unexpected last minute issues. Should go out in next day or two.
7153," First orbital stack of Starship should be ready for flight in a few weeks, pending only regulatory approval"
7154, Probably sooner

7166, Major Supercharger openings in west LA coming soon!
7167," Starship will be crushingly cost-effective for Earth orbit or moon missions as soon as it’s operational &amp; rapid reuse is happening. 

Mars is a lot harder, because Earth &amp; Mars only align every 26 months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship."
7168," All models do make use of aluminum casting, but new Y will be most advanced with 2/3 of body cast."
7169," Sorry, it’s been pretty intense lately"

7187, Yes on both counts. That would be a great outcome for civilization.
7188," Preferably, on Mars"
7189, I will welcome death when it comes
7190," And ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for moon &amp; Mars until there is local infrastructure."
7191, Pretty close. Booster &amp; arms will move faster. QD arm will steady booster for ship mate.
7192,"Priority for residents of Brandenburg &amp; Berlin, but also open to general public"

7195, The staying power of a bad idea is astonishing
7196," Note, should be “refill”, not “refuel”. ~78% of propellant is liquid oxygen, only ~22% is fuel."
7197," Tesla makes cars for export in first half of quarter &amp; for local market in second half. 

As publicly disclosed, we are operating under extreme supply chain limitations regarding certain “standard” automotive chips. 

Most problematic by far are Renesas &amp; Bosch."
7198," Booster &amp; Ship will return to orbital launch pad on Monday (winds allowing). Just finishing off some small plumbing &amp; wiring, which is easier in high bay."
7199, I hope I do
7200, Yup
7201," If lobbying &amp; lawyers could get u to orbit, Bezos would be on Pluto rn"
7202, Exactly
7203," Somehow, this wasn’t convincing …"
7204, I’d recommend they get their first plant working. It’s insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.
7205, It’s gonna be awesome
7206, Yup
7207," However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times."
7208," 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.

Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights."
7209, Yeah
7210," Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of ~10,000 unique parts in a car"
7211, SpaceX could do it if need be
7212, Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen

7217," Agreed, this is not the time to pick technology winners or losers in cryptocurrency technology. There is no crisis that compels hasty legislation."
7218, Long time
7219,An honor to work with such a great team
7220, Sure
7221, It will be exciting to see what new cultures humanity creates on other heavenly bodies!
7222," Due to its size &amp; ability to return science instruments even from deep space, Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions"
7223,Minus the lifts
7224," There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built – it’s an insanely hard problem. 

Moreover, it must be rapidly &amp; completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary.

Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large."
7225, Ok
7226," Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:

Booster
- Grid fins for aero control
- Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Protecting engines from entry loads

Ship
- Body flaps for aero control
- Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Heat shield"
7227, Inevitably
7228," Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V."
7229," It is ~98% done, but the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining"
7230," 4 significant items:

- Final heat shield tiles for ship
- Thermal protection of booster engines
- Ground propellant storage tanks
- QD arm for ship

2 weeks."

7233,Starship Fully Stacked
7234, 🤍 🖤
7235, Probably
7236," Tesla Automation (Deutschland) built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension. 

If too low, it would come loose at low temp, due to CTE differences. If too high, it would snap at high temp &amp; rpm."
7237," Total coincidence! Also, booster height was originally 70m, but we eliminated a half barrel for manufacturing efficiency, so now it’s …"
7238, DMTwitter
7239," Reality is total opposite of what detractors say! Biggest challenge is recruiting enough people to build cars. 

SF Bay Area essentially has negative unemployment, so people at our factory have several other job offers. If they weren’t treated well, they would leave immediately!"
7240," Once Mechazilla is operational, winds will rarely be an issue"
7241, 👍
7242,Winds are too high today. Looks like wind speed will be low enough to stack early tomorrow morning.
7243, Remaining tiles are on their way!
7244, Irony indeed
7245,Aiming to stack ship on booster today
7247, It would be an honor to have you visit Starbase
7248," Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited"
7249, He’s shadowed me for several days so far
7250, Makes sense

7255,"If you’re curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp; my general goings on, is writing a biography"
7256," I have great admiration for John’s engineering ability! What he did with Armadillo was incredible. 

I’ve tried to convince him many times to join SpaceX, but he has always declined (sigh)."
7257,"Mechazilla will do this for future rockets, but it’s not quite ready yet"
7258,Moving rocket to orbital launch pad
7259, That is the goal. Our official name is actually Space Exploration Technologies. SpaceX is short form.
7260," I do think that great design &amp; engineering of products are critical, but manufacturing &amp; supply chain require orders of magnitude more work"
7261,All 6 engines mounted to first orbital Starship
7262," I thought we had lost for sure. We were just a tiny company back then, only 1 of 4 launches got to orbit &amp; I had no money left. Out of the blue, a few days before Christmas, NASA calls to say we won."
7263," Just want to say thanks to those in government who fight hard for the right thing to happen, despite extreme pressure to do otherwise. 

Therein lies the core goodness of the American state."
7264," I do love NASA, always have"
7265, It’s true
7266, Mars looks amazing
7267, We stole the idea from Karate Kid
7268," Pitch control requires more force than yaw &amp; much more force than roll. Also, grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective. 

However, pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only 2 grid fins, with some effect on accuracy."
7269, Thanks Sandy!
7270,Super Heavy Booster moving to orbital launch mount
7271," Very close to real! Arms are able to move during descent to match exact booster position. 

Catch point is off to side, in case catch fails – don’t want to hit launch mount. 

Booster is transferred back to launch mount for next flight. 

Designed to have &lt;1 hour turnaround."
7272, That’s about right. Civilization can be powered with a very small % of Earth having solar panels.
7273, I was asked by a reporter if I was optimistic or pessimistic about SpaceX’s future. That was my answer.
7274, 2008 was an extremely tough year on every level

7286, We are doing releases every 2 weeks on Friday at midnight California time
7287, 370 tons
7288, They do
7289," Reason we hustled so much to get Autopilot V1 out was that someone driving non-Autopilot Tesla fell asleep, crashed &amp; killed cyclist (Tesla driver was uninjured).

Driver nonetheless sued us saying new car smell made him fall asleep (sigh). Judge didn’t agree."
7290," Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not. 

Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity &amp; so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure. 

Potential future optimization."
7291, The Tesla AI predictions are swiftly becoming superhuman – its guesses for what it can’t see well feel like ESP. It has a vastly larger training set than any human &amp; thinks only about driving.
7292," There is always a lot of cleanup after a major code release. Beta 9.2 will be tight. 

Still some fundamentals to solve for Beta 10, but now that we’re pure vision, progress is much faster. Radar was holding us back."
7293, Will post once we have a decent simulation. Our first design will probably be far from the bullseye.
7294," Stage Zero, which is everything needed to launch &amp; catch the rocket, is at least as hard as the booster or ship"

7305," If we are wrong, we are wrong. In this case, we were."
7306," Yeah, Liftoff is solid"
7307, !!
7308," Indeed. Both Cook &amp; I have been clear publicly that we have never spoken or otherwise communicated. I tried to speak to him &amp; he declined. 

Nor have I ever expressed any interest in running Apple to anyone. Cook is, all things considered, obviously doing an incredible job."
7309, He does like to play with my phone. There are many confusing videos he has taken.
7310," Sorry, accidental tap!"
7311," That’s arguably a security issue, but  allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair.

As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees.

As for the cost of reviewing apps for security, a fixed fee makes sense."
7312," Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple &amp; Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, it’s basically a monopoly. 

The effective 30% sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry."
7313, Top feature request for sure
7314," Actually, I like &amp; use Apple products. 

They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable. 

Epic wouldn’t bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair."
7315, GAO 💪
7316,Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.
7317," Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. 

There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. 

He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today’s value."

Self-driving requires solving a major part of real-world AI, so it’s an insanely hard problem, but Tesla is getting it done. 

AI Day will be great."
7326, We are a pattern of ancient atoms
7327, Mass to orbit is the fundamental metric for making life multiplanetary
7328, Upmass is what matters. One Starship will lift what all Falcons did in Q2 on a single flight.
7329," Indeed, there are some giant mosquitoes around here!"
7330, So many tubes …
7331," Raptor V2.0 is a major improvement in simplication, while also increasing thrust from ~185 tons to ~230 tons. Long-term goal is engine cost below $1000/ton of thrust."
7332, And that’s just the primary fuel lines! The maze of secondary plumbing &amp; wiring is our greatest concern.
7333," Yeah, SpaceX team is cranking hard!"
7334,Completing feed system for 29 Raptor rocket engines on Super Heavy Booster
7335, Feels so long ago
7336, Haha true. I talked to my friends about electric cars constantly in college.
7337, Congrats!
7338, Congratulations!
7339, True
7340, Yeah
7341, Dojo is designed for NN training. No emulation needed.
7342, Convincing the best AI talent to join Tesla is the sole goal
7343,Tesla AI Day August 19th
7344, 🤔
7345, Nice
7346," Haha ok, I will do the Tesla shareholder meeting in a posh British accent"
7347," These guys are either shady, 🥜 or both. I mean seriously there’s a long list of companies to pick on before Tesla …"
7348," At this point, just count atoms &amp; dispense with nm"
7349," We don’t have that many Bitcoin, but it’s close"
7350, 😉
7351, Congrats SpaceX tower team &amp; supporting contractors!
7352," Orbital precession takes a long time. With Starship &amp; Starlink V2.0, hopefully we can direct inject to target orbit."
7353,Haha
7354, I am already chewing on so much glass that I have chipmunk cheeks!
7355, I’m so dying to do a supersonic vtol electric jet! But I already have way too much on my plate. Any more work and my brain will explode.
7356," That’s a low bar. Carmakers have never valued software engineering highly, although VW is trying to change that. 

I personally wrote software for 20 years &amp; have huge respect for software engineers. Tesla is on par with best software companies &amp; is leader in real world AI."
7357," Tesla software team is excellent even when compared to the best software companies. This is a big deal, as cars are very much computers on wheels."
7358, Great work by Tesla Giga Berlin team &amp; supporting contractors!
7359, 🤣
7360, Good thread
7361, Fair enough
7362, And that’s just for Earth! Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.
7363,Population collapse is potentially the greatest risk to the future of civilization
7364," Cars today are far more complex than Model T, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk. 

Like Model T, supply chain for battery EVs simply doesn’t exist at massive scale, so must be built in parallel.

Ideas are easy, production is hard."
7365," Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range. 

I’m not saying Tesla will do aircraft – we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation – just that max energy density is needed for aircraft."
7366, Indeed
7367," We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place."
7369,The Biggest Bang Theory
7370, Amazing
7371, That is the acid test
7372," Computers are absurdly more accurate than humans. 

How long would it take for a human to render even one frame of a modern video game at low res? The computer will do high res at 120 frames per second. Not a contest."
7373, Quaternions are important for orbital spaceflight
7374, Cool
7375," 🤣🤣 although to be fair, I dig my own grave a lot"
7376," Austin now, but back at Starbase tomorrow"
7377, Norway has played a major role in supporting advent of electric vehicles!
7378," Seriously, we’re getting eaten alive. Can’t get to Mars if the bugs eat us first."
7379, Length will grow by ~500 ft over time
7380," The building is ~7 stores tall, so each “floor” is double size. Hard to appreciate unless you’re close."
7381, I was at Giga Texas yesterday. Team is making excellent progress. Building will be almost a mile long when complete.
7382, Construction starts soon on a much larger high bay just north of current high bay
7384, Several improvements coming via V9.1 on Friday at midnight
7385, Tesla Giga Shanghai team has done amazing work!
7386,And finally
7387, Or does he?
7388, 2 weeks
7392, 🤣
7393, Haha
7395, Is the Pope Catholic?
7396, That was me after Cyberpunk Razor fight haha
7397,Being thanked by game NPCs brought me real joy tbh
7398, The comments on this article are funny
7399," Large pouch cells undergo significant volumetric changes at high state of charge.

Even so, fire risk is probably less than gasoline cars. There are over 200,000 combustion engine car fires every year in US alone. It’s literally in the name.
"
7400, Sure
7401," Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport."
7402," Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!

Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.

Making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. Got to be done."
7403, More of a pathfinder test. Actual payload bay door dimensions are still under debate. Volume is ~1000 cubic meters. Roomy …
7404, That’s the goal!
7405, The feeling is mutual. But I can’t emphasize enough that we work with an amazing team. The credit is theirs.
7406, Maybe I will. It’s on PC now.
7407," I couldn’t do WoW. Awesome, but too much time required."
7408, Great game
7409," If Tesla is able to succeed with imported vehicles, then a factory in India is quite likely."
7410, Very impressive!
7411, But we are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles. That would be much appreciated.
7412, Tesla Model S Plaid is alien technology
7413, No
7414," Also, the full self-driving interface renders across the whole display &amp; it is incredible. The yoke enables an unobstructed view of the screen."
7415," Good review &amp; fair critique. 

In general with interfaces, all input is error. With each software update, the car’s intuition will get better. You will need to press buttons less &amp; less &amp; it will know when to ignore accidental button presses."
7416, Minimizing $/ton to the surface of Mars is the fundamental optimization
7417, This will become very important over time
7418, 🤣🤣
7419, Flight tests showed that we could make body flaps narrower &amp; lighter
7420, Also lasts much longer than normal roofs &amp; is able to withstand hail &amp; other medium-sized impacts
7421, Congrats Cathie!
7422," Seriously, negative nominal interest rates!? What is the world coming to …"
7423," But, much more important, is that this *design* is capable of full &amp; rapid reusability. 

Long way to go from design to making it actually fully &amp; rapidly reusable with high payload, but at least success is *one* of the possible outcomes haha."
7424," Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries. 

That said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwell’s proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production &amp; we’re still not quite done."
7425," Ironic indeed, as I was at one point going to do my PhD at Stanford on high energy density capacitors for use in electric vehicles. 

But lithium-ion has it covered. Even with no advances in lithium-ion technology, it’s possible to transition Earth to sustainable energy."
7426, Nice
7427," Over time, all countries"
7428, Congrats!
7429," We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. 

It’s one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. 

That said, we’re making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year."
7430, Great to hear!
7431, Best of luck tomorrow!
7432, Haha
7433," Depending on progress with Booster 4, we might try a 9 engine firing on Booster 3"
7434,Full test duration firing of 3 Raptors on Super Heavy Booster!
7435," Sure, I have a ton"
7436," During this talk, we will sing a cover of The Final Countdown by Europe"
7437, Nice
7438, Haha
7439, You don’t even need to touch the shifter in new S. Auto detect direction will come as an optional setting to all cars with FSD.

7447, Cool!
7448," There’s a corner case where brick density is same density as water, reaching bottom due to momentum"
7449,Fred Astaire is incredible. Worth watching his movies. One of a kind.

7456, A classic
7457, True
7459, Haha
7460, Roughly
7461, Yes
7462," Wide beta maybe with FSD rev 10, definitely with rev 11"
7463, Pure coincidence!
7464, Even smaller to a chip
7465," To date, AI chatbots have had a rather short MtH (meantime to Hitler) score. Tay was ~16 hours."
7466," Some of these design trades are still open, but will be resolved soon"
7467, Very accurate!
7468, Improving permit approval speed &amp; lowering permit costs for solar would make a big difference
7469, Do you even press?
7470," Indeed, but again like a parking lot, a battery having big “roads” tends to decrease number of “parking spaces” (ie stores less energy)"
7471, Those are major factors
7472, Absolutely!
7473, Probably Monday
7474, Yes
7475," FSD beta 9 is using the pure vision production code for highway driving. Beta 10 hopefully (Beta 11 definitely) will use one stack to rule them all – city streets, highway &amp; complex parking lots."
7476, How about a wifi camera link?
7477," In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better.

No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door.

Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns!"
7478, Version 3 of the SpaceX droneship. Team did great work! Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship.
7479," To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. 

I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t. 

Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future."
7480," Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”. 

Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full."
7481," Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range. 

Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW, so that will help too."
7482," Yeah, I wuz running on almost no sleep"
7483, Yup
7484, Some traffic could just go terminal -&gt; satellite -&gt; satellite -&gt; terminal and never touch the regular Internet
7485, Good point
7486," If we can do this successfully, then anything developed for ground/undersea fiber is automatically better in orbit"
7487," Similar to fiber optic. We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function, but modified for use in vacuum."
7488, Yeah
7489," Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber"
7490," More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms."
7491," 🙏 

A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great"
7492," Glad it’s working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing. 

Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. We’re aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically, you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink."

7495,Some light reading with lil X
7496," Due to lack of banging, civilization might ended with a whimper! Adult diaper sales growth is much higher than baby diaper sales growth. "
7497," This is a major problem! Between civilization ending with a bang or a whimper, this trend suggests the latter."

7501, Me too!
7502," I’m trying to set a good example! Population collapse is a much bigger problem than people realize and that’s just for Earth.

Mars has a great need for people, seeing as population is currently zero.

Humans are the custodians of other life on Earth. Let us bring life to Mars!"
7503," It was Richard’s rental house, which overall is great, but I agree regarding the cabinets haha. This was 3am, day of flight. Wasn’t expecting this brutal pic of me to be posted, but oh well."
7504, Indeed … sigh
7505, 🤣🤣
7506, I’m trying to set a good example!
7507, Population collapse is what’s actually happening
7508, Booster is more than half cost of mission. Fairing is ~10%.
7509, Any money transmitter or other licenses needed to use this in USA?
7510," Took more work to make F9 booster reuse cost-effective than went into recovering it in the first place. This is an important point.

Things finally clicked into place with Block 5. My hat is off to everyone at SpaceX, NASA, Space Force, FAA &amp; suppliers who helped make it happen."
7511," I’m actually 3000 years old, but, at the risk of being immodest, I think I look good even for 2500 years! Still have my original chariot license in papyrus …"

7526," It will soon capture turn signals, hazards, ambulance/police lights &amp; even hand gestures"
7527, Spaceport design is cool
7528," Final decision made earlier this week on booster engine count. Will be 33 at ~230 (half million lbs) sea-level thrust. All engines on booster are same, apart from deleting gimbal &amp; thrust vector actuators for outer 20."
7529," Congratulations, beautiful flight!"
7530, Godspeed!
7531, Yes. It will be the highest output &amp; most advanced rocket engine factory in the world.
7532, The challenges of operating at Starbase left us with no choice but to put engine production in McGregor
7533, Thanks Austin :)
7534," Roughly 800 to 1000 per year. That’s about what’s needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. City itself probably takes roughly 20 years, so hopefully it is built by ~2050."
7535, McGregor
7536," By “volume production”, I mean 2 to 4 engines per day. That’s super high volume for big rocket engines, but low volume by automotive standards."
7537," We are breaking ground soon on a second Raptor factory at SpaceX Texas test site. This will focus on volume production of Raptor 2, while California factory will make Raptor Vacuum &amp; new, experimental designs."
7538, 😍
7539," Yeah, goal is to reflect reality, so screen render will become increasingly so"
7540," Accurate assessment. 

Btw, Autopilot software is technically led by Ashok, Andrej &amp; Milan, but it’s very much a “knights of the round table” structure. 

There are so many talented engineers on Autopilot/AI team &amp; they decide for themselves what to work on. Kinda like Valve."
7541," Mind of car visualization will improve a lot in coming releases. 

Brightness/translucency indicate confidence of neural net in predicting any given object.

Acid test is being able to assess with quick glance at screen if car fully understands environment."

7549," It won’t need to reach visa speed, as regulated exchanges will act as de facto second layer. 

But the perfect should not be the enemy of the good – it is still good to increase base layer transaction speed &amp; lower base layer transaction cost."
7550, Block size &amp; frequency should steadily increase to match broadly available bandwidth
7551," When even someone in California, home of Silicon Valley, needs Internet so bad that they bolt a Starlink dish to the hood of their car, you know there’s a serious unmet need!"

7589, Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia (to Serbian parents)!
7590, Yes
7591," And by 2060, Tesla production will exceed the mass of the Universe!"
7592," Yeah, that would be cool. Also, using ship itself as structure for new giant telescope that’s &gt;10X Hubble resolution. Was talking to Saul Perlmutter (who’s awesome) &amp; he suggested wanting to do that."
7593,Supersonic shock wave
7595," We could stretch the Falcon Heavy upper stage &amp; increase this a lot, but FH already covers all known payloads.

Starship, especially with orbital refilling &amp; dedicated deep space variants (no heatshield, flaps or header tanks) will take this up orders of magnitude."
7596, Absolutely! Staggeringly insane amount of work between now and then.
7597,High res landing Falcon landing video
7598, Accurate. Show that Falcon Heavy addresses all use cases.

7613," Booster engines are not shrouded by skirt extension, as with ship. Engines extend about 3m below booster."
7614, It’s one possibility
7615, Kinda has to happen :)
7616," Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.

Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp). 

Adding 3 more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe …"
7617," All Raptors on booster, whether fixed or gimbaling, would be the same. 33*230 gets ~7600 tons of thrust &amp; T/W of ~1.5."
7618, Looking good at ~378 sec. Continued improvement will get it over 380.
7619,Happy 4th to all!
7620,Bless America
7621, Current plan is to increase base Raptor thrust to ~230 tons or ~500 million lbs &amp; increase booster engine count to 32 or 33

Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect.

Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality."
7629, There is a big difference between reaching space and reaching orbit
7630," Friday afternoons are usually Tesla design studio time. Cybertruck will be almost exactly what was shown. We’re adding rear wheel steering, so it can do tight turns &amp; maneuver with high agility.

Lot of other great things coming."
7631, Fair enough
7632, Both great

7646, Sure. We can show them live. Eerily realistic. Maybe we should make a game.
7647," When we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, Tesla sim delivers. 

Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples.

For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers."
7648, But can I pay in Doge?
7649, But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love
7650," What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition."
7651," Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract.

In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter."
7652, Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
7653,Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added
7654," Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. 

Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload."
7655, Million tons to Mars requires R R R
7656,Super Heavy moves tomorrow
7657," Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X. 

In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V."
7658,"Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
Baby Doge"
7659, C
7660, It’s like looking in a mirror
7661,Release the Doge!
7662,Stop gendering memes … I mean mimes
7663," Of course, you can’t take that literally – he meant the whole dairy industry"
7664," Yeah, had great Poutine in Montreal. Does feel like your life expectancy is dropping in real-time as you eat it, but awesome nonetheless."
7665," Sorry for any confusion. Dojo is a neural network training computer optimized for video (for self-driving). 

Unless there is a predictable pattern to hashing Scrypt (which we will not attempt to find), it will not be competitive with ASIC-based hashing. 

Potatoes are delicious!"
7666," I do live in a $50k house, but not this specific one"
7667," The economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing, especially in infrastructure! I encourage people to visit and see for themselves."
7668, Impressive
7669," Now, this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it. 

However, in this case, it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary, which is the goal of SpaceX, vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing.

Not ok."
7670," Yeah, but dogz rūl"
7671," ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement. 

If this is not true, then you won’t have a problem removing it.

Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source. 

Seems a little inconsistent …"
7672, Yeah
7673," Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero."
7674, You should notice several other improvements
7675,"Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R 🏴‍☠️"
7676," We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5."
7677," First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships."
7678," Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower."
7679, Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.
7680," Should I bring a few spare engines … I mean, just in case."
7681, Sure
7682, I liked your movie “Hollywood Dirt”!
7683," There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too. 

That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July."
7684, When do the engines arrive? 😉
7685," Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic. 

There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken."
7686, Sonic boom incoming
7687," Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! That’s the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too. 

Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers."
7688, Not bad
7689," Production release update coming this week, which includes raising max speed to 80 mph. Sorry, 75 mph limit was done as precautionary measure. Turned out to be unnecessary."
7690,Thanks for all the happy birthday wishes!
7691, Important to support
7692," It is! Looks like we can get 378 sec Isp with this version of Raptor Vacuum, so over 380 sec with some improvements down the road."
7693, ❤️
7694, Cool
7696," Schedule driver there is regulatory approval. Has to be certified for each aircraft type. Focusing on 737 &amp; A320, as those serve most number of people, with development testing on Gulfstream."
7697,"All 72 orbital planes activate in August, plus many other improvements, enabling global coverage, except for polar regions, which will take another 6 months"
7698,"Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!"
7699," Sometimes people think it is performance, but safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla"

7704, Starship Super Heavy
7705, True
7706,My Shiba Inu will be named Floki
7707,Timing is everything
7708," I’m driving “alpha” 9, but we need to fix some obvious issues before releasing beta 9, hopefully next week. FSD subscription capability should be turning on via the Tesla app."
7709," “It will be like this, but bigger”"
7710," For the Bitcurious? Very well then, let’s do it 😉"
7711, T is the new D
7712, I think about that quite a lot
7713, The comments in this thread are solid gold
7714, Lmfao omg
7715," Nothing wrong with healthy competition, but this seems a little over-the-top. Would be cool if spacecraft could travel from one space station to another (which is much harder than it seems!)."
7716," Basically, just a footnote"
7717, 🔥🔥
7718, Edgy
7719,“That’s not funny!” – Bitcoin maxis
7720, We’re almost done with first prototype booster. This will go to test stand A. Next one will fly to orbit. Team has been crushing it many days &amp; nights in a row!
7721, Oh right … Bitcoin haha
7722, Bicurious?
7723, #gravitas
7724, 🍻
7725, That is an exciting goal!
7726," Cool, but an unnecessary complication for now. These are being removed to speed up time to orbital launch."
7727, 🤣🤣
7728, Wow!
7729, At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.
7730,Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!
7731," Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate."
7732, ??
7733, This is an important improvement
7734, Very sorry to hear that. Condolences to JB and his family.
7735, Tesla financing round closed at 6pm Dec 24th 2008 – last hour of last day possible or payroll would’ve bounced 2 days later. I gave Tesla last of my remaining cash from PayPal. Didn’t even own a house or anything sellable.
7736,"Looking at holding Tesla AI Day in about a month or so. Will go over progress with Tesla AI software &amp; hardware, both training &amp; inference. Purpose is recruiting."
7737, “physical-world” sigh
7738,Happy Father’s Day!
7739, Yeah
7740, Nice work

7746, Haha
7747,Real pic of 2 ships next to Starbase Tiki Bar on right
7748, True
7749, Steam engines are even better!
7750, I’ve been driving with the yoke for a while &amp; it’s great imo. Progressive steering would require complex gearing or drive-by-wire without direct mechanical link. Will aim for that in a few years.
7751," Congratulations, this is a great achievement!"
7752, We might use SN16 on a hypersonic flight test
7753, Fair enough
7754, Based on what data?
7755, Cool
7756, Manufacturing is so hard. I have the utmost respect for those who build things.
7757, It is an honor to work with such talented engineers
7758,Let’s just skip original video games &amp; movies &amp; go straight to the sequel
7759, Massive increase in Supercharger network is underway

7762, εἰδέναι μὲν μηδὲν πλὴν αὐτὸ τοῦτο εἰδέναι
7763, Nice
7764, Maybe we should advertise informationally just so people know stuff like this exists
7765, Most people have no idea just how good the Tesla air purification system is. Literally 10X better than any other car.
7766," Oh man, home hvac that is super energy efficient, quiet &amp; purifies the air would be great. We developed it for the car, but it can be scaled up for home use."
7767, New HVAC firmware coming soon that will make it quieter
7768," True, we somewhat overcompensated on Bluetooth antenna capability haha. Will work on turning it down near your destination."

7779, Decided to sell my last remaining house. Just needs to go to a large family who will live there. It’s a special place.
7780," After several successful launches, land overflight earlier in trajectory passes E-sub-c safety threshold. That said, Starship will also launch from Cape long-term."
7781, So much more is needed for life to become multiplanetary
7782,!!
7783,This is true
7784,Our Soul Dichotomy
7785," This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.

When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions."
7786," The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! 

We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!"
7787," Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
7788," Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. 

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator."
7789, True

7800, I love the yoke!
7801, Tesla engineering is awesome!
7802, People like it!
7803, Starlink missions will move to Starship
7804, Useful mass to orbit is the primary figure of merit
7806, Exactly
7807," Now that I have made some improvements, I’m pretty sure it’s worth $69k haha"
7808," My primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. It’s kinda awesome though.

Only house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day."
7809," Yeah, sold my houses, except for 1 in Bay Area that’s rented out for events. 

Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla &amp; protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX. Also, AI risk mitigation with Neuralink &amp; fixing traffic with Boring."
7810," Exactly. Only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring &amp; I have no choice. 

Btw, I will continue to pay income taxes in California proportionate to my time in state, which is &amp; will be significant."
7811," Not even a good fake anonymous “The article is behind a paywall, and it looks like Anonymous’ hacking skills are not enough to get behind it “ 🤣🤣"

7828," Tbh, I was into PC &amp; still into PC"
7829," One more production release of pure vision this week, then FSD beta 9 a week or two later. V9.0 FSD is also pure vision. Foundational improvements are immense."
7830, Maybe
7831, I do like to cause a little mischief
7833, He will perhaps have a baby soon
7835, The operating costs of a Tesla are also much lower than a gasoline cruiser!

7864, 🤔
7865, Some quarks &amp; a lepton walk into a bar …
7866, Things get weird at the driver level
7867," That’s where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).

Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs &amp; mid range cars."
7869, We went public for $3.40/share!
7870, Science-fiction should not be fiction forever!
7871, Might take a few kicks at the can before we catch the rocket haha
7872," Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it. 

Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.

That said, it’s obv not a long-term issue."

7881, Nice
7882, Agreed
7883," Making this work has been / still is super difficult, but it’s a revolution in car body design &amp; production – lighter, tighter, better NVH, higher precision, lower capex, lower unit cost"
7884," Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of 3/Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used.

Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially."
7885," Pretty close. Inner ring is closer to center 3, as all 12 gimbal together. Boost back burn efficiency is greatly improved in this config."

7890," Actually, so-called “secondary” structure is the hard part – so many pipes &amp; wires. 

Tall stuff &amp; small stuff are the toughest things about Starship."
7891, True
7892, 250M years is only ~6% increase in age of Earth
7893, Raptor production is approaching one every 48 hours
7894," 29 Raptors on Booster initially, rising to 32 later this year, along with thrust increase per engine. Aiming for &gt;7500 ton thrust long-term. T/W ~1.5."

7902,"Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak.

This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance."
7903, Vegas FTW!
7904, Exactly. Atmospheric drag clearing out orbital debris is a major reason why we dropped altitude to ~550km.
7905, I suspect that name made him strong
7906," For the low, low price of … ?"
7908, 🤣🤣
7909,"Ship 16 &amp; Booster 2, Starbase Highbay"
7910," Tesla sure would appreciate changing the law, so that this is not required!"
7911, Exactly
7912," Potentially, 1000 times higher"
7913, Pretty close. No tiles on back side of flaps. Some tiles towards leeward side of ship trailing plasma spilling off rear of flaps.
7914, Cumulative payload to orbit is the really crazy number. Falcon has delivered more than double rest of world combined over trailing 12 months.

7919, Yup
7920, Aiming to have hot gas thrusters on booster for first orbital flight
7921," They are now the same (LOX below CH4). Ox is 3.5 times heavier than fuel, so makes sense to have it lower."
7922," Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time."

7931, Congrats!
7933," Becoming multiplanetary is one of the greatest filters. Only now, 4.5 billion years after Earth formed, is it possible. 

How long this window to reach Mars remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time, perhaps not. 

In case it is the latter, we should act now."
7934, The hard part about Raptor is simplifying it

7940, This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars &amp; now making one. Fate 🖤 irony haha.
7941," We can’t wait to build this crazy truck! It’s a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods, so super hard project, but worthwhile in the end."
7942," Achieving truly decentralized finance – power to the people – is a noble &amp; important goal. 

Layer count depends on projected bandwidth &amp; compute, both rising rapidly, which means single layer network can carry all human transactions in future imo.

For now, Lightning is needed."
7943," Ideally 0.1kWh, calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate"
7944," Yes, with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe, but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition – same as a hardcore roller coaster."
7945, Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
7946," I agree that this *can* be done over time, but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables.

This question is easily resolved if the top 10 hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not."
7947, 🤣🤣
7948," Yeah, I haven’t &amp; won’t sell any Doge"
7949, A longtime Tesla supporter gave me the Doge dollar sticker at Giga Berlin

7951," It will have high pressure air rocket thrusters behind a license plate that flips down. Bong, James Bong …"
7952, Good idea
7953, Sure
7954, Worth reading
7955," Currency is already digital! Decentralized crypto is an attempt to wrest power of currency dilution (pernicious form of taxation) &amp; capital controls from governments. That said, I sure hope the cure is better than the disease!

7982, Indeed
7983," Hey cryptocurrency “experts”, ever heard of PayPal? It’s possible … maybe … that I know than you realize about how money works."
7984," Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies. 

A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and Bitcoin hash rate dropped 35%. Sound “decentralized” to you?

7990," For those bad at math 👆, 100X higher transaction volume with 100X lower fees means total fees earned stay same. Low fees &amp; high volume are needed to become currency of Earth."
7991, My understanding is that the big accounts are exchanges. Would be good to confirm though. Am told the biggest one is Robinhood.
7992, Only if Doge can’t do it. Big pain in the neck to create another one.
7993," Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X &amp; drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down."

8010," End of year, along with FSD, provided we get regulatory approval. Smart Summon is just a subset of FSD."
8011, Yes
8012, We had to focus on removing radar &amp; confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD &amp; v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 &amp; v9 is gigantic.

8060," Only limitation is high density of users in urban areas. Most likely, all of the initial 500k will receive service. More of a challenge when we get into the several million user range."
8061," Rawlinson was never chief engineer. He arrived after Model S prototype was made, left before things got tough &amp; was only ever responsible for body engineering, not powertrain, battery, software, production or design."
8062, So great to see the happy faces!

8074,"A major part of real-world AI has to be solved to make unsupervised, generalized full self-driving work, as the entire road system is designed for biological neural nets with optical imagers"
8075, Exactly!
8076, Was using this in my car last night
8077, FSD display V9.0 will show actual probability distribution of objects – true mind’s eye of the neural net. This is so cool!
8078, I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible!
8079, True. Anyone paying attention to the rate of improvement will realize that Tesla Autopilot/FSD is already superhuman for highway driving &amp; swiftly getting there for city streets.
8080," Hopefully, later this year for several more states. Insurance is different for almost every state in America &amp; regulatory approvals take time."
8081, And hopefully EU this summer
8082, Probably a few months. There are many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada driving.
8083," Gating factor is achieving &amp; proving higher safety with pure vision than with vision+radar. We are almost there.

FSD Beta V9.0 will blow your mind."

Strange that they aren’t taking more action on some of the SPACs."
8101," FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. 99.9% of the time, I agree with regulators! 

On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn’t anticipate."
8102," Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product. 

I trust the people."
8103, Yes
8104, Yup
8105," I find it more helpful to read/follow individual journalists, rather than publications. 

Any given publication is going to have wide range of views, albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative, perhaps reflecting innate human biases.

Citizen journalism FTW!"

8110, Seems quite likely at least based on revenue in 2022 &amp; possibly total units in 2023
8111," No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet."
8112, Yes
8113," Yeah, roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels. 

What’s really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!"

When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don’t even flicker. Owner says he doesn’t notice."
8138, Does seem a little weird
8139, 🤣
8140," If Tesla owners are “conspiracy theorists”, then it would be fair to call them “advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers”. 

If that’s an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths …"
8141,Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
8142, True
8143," Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries."
8144," Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc."
8145,"Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. 

Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. 

Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp."
8146,"Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts."
8147,"Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery"
8148," Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid."

8158, Exactly
8159, Awesome!
8160," Your research as a private individual is better than professionals! 

Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.

Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have."
8161, Support for humanity’s future in space is super appreciated. Let’s make the sci-fi future we want real!
8162, 🤣🤣
8163," Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer."

8177," Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades."
8178," This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer."

8193, Insanely cute!
8194," Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing."
8195, Hopefully addressed this summer
8196, 🤣🤣
8197, Same timing
8198," Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.

This is a “march of 9’s” trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving."
8199, Will investigate
8200, Probably late July
8201,Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Making excellent progress solving real-world AI.
8202, 69th Raptor engine coming soon
8203, Maybe it’s about how you use it
8204, Getting there
8205," That version of Falcon 1 never flew, so must be ~2004. The CAD looks so simple! I think we were still using SolidWorks back then."
8206," Yeah, not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level."
8207, That was my night job. Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.
8208," True. Ancient times … Had to flip CPU registers explicitly, as computer was so slow."
8209, Absolutely
8210," Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their “approved” collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing."

8221, Good thread
8222, Pretty much
8223, These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.
8224," Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind."
8225," When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion."
8226,Just needs some legs

8258," Absolutely doable. Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version 2, highly likely by version 3."
8259,"Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again"

8268,Thanks Tesla suppliers for providing us with critical parts!
8269, A tidal wave of vaccine is being produced!
8270," Probably J&amp;J, but BioNtech &amp; Moderna are good too. Some debate imo as to whether a second synthetic mRNA shot is really needed, but the first is a no-brainer."
8271, Latter
8272,"To be clear, I do support vaccines in general &amp; covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. 

In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen."
8273, Needs legs for moon &amp; Mars
8274, Global payload to orbit is the key metric
8275, Nice
8276," Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal “glide” with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs)."
8277," Starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. Big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour."
8278, Coming soon. Crazy number of launches this year!

8291," Ascent phase, transition to horizontal &amp; control during free fall were good. 

A (relatively) small CH4 leak led to fire on engine 2 &amp; fried part of avionics, causing hard start attempting landing burn in CH4 turbopump. 

This is getting fixed 6 ways to Sunday."

8296, Haha Falcon? Nein!
8297," I recommend propulsive landing, as that is extensible to planets, moons &amp; asteroids. Wings &amp; runways are limited to Earth."
8298," For practical purposes, there is no limit. It will just get increasingly difficult to service."
8299," This a good path, but I recommend aiming for full reusability"
8300,Urgent need to build more housing in greater Austin area!

Back on the stand soon!
Will report conclusions as soon as we know them."
8316,Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
8317, I sure hope so!
8318," Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power."
8319,Probably most “in space” you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome
8320,Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools &amp; $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.
8321," BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2. 

Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky."
8322,"Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so! 

SpaceX’s hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly."
8323, More like V10.0
8324," Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact."
8325," SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine. 

Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days."
8326," Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed. 

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today."
8327, At least the crater is in the right place!
8328, A high production rate solves many ills
8329," Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year."
8330, Tracking to a potential 8am liftoff
8331," That would be great, or possibly via video with full access to telemetry"

8344,Check out our new crane
8345, This appears to be widespread. I wonder who is doing it …
8346," We are too cell-constrained right now, but probably ok next year"
8347, Great video
8348, Standing down SN11 until probably Monday. Additional checkouts are needed. Doing our best to land &amp; fully recover.
8349, Haha
8350," Heavy comes in more like a javelin. Similar to Falcon 9, but caught by the tower vs landing on legs."

8377, I once did a road trip across most of US with 2 adults &amp; 5 kids in a Model S!
8378," They are aiming too low. 

Only rockets that are fully &amp; rapidly reusable will be competitive. 

Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets."
8379, The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to 7 people.
8380," SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary — full &amp; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth.

Starlink‘s purpose is to provide Internet to the least served &amp; to pay for Mars."
8381, Going well. Lot of work for an extra 20 secs of Isp!
8382, True
8383, I am accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary &amp; extend the light of consciousness to the stars
8384," When vast amounts of manufacturing are needed, as in robotaxis, this slows down rate of introduction, so maybe more like winner-takes-a-quarter. Still great."
8385," Not trying to roast, just being as literal as possible"
8386, 🤣🤣
8387," Yeah, but I’m English"
8388," Not quite how I would tell the story, but it’s probably worth a read"

8408, The high bay is measured to fit!
8409, We will need launch tower for that. Hook height for the lift is ~140 m &amp; both booster &amp; ship need to be stabilized at stage separation joint.
8410," Yes, Booster 1 is a production pathfinder, figuring out how to build &amp; transport 70 meter tall stage. Booster 2 will fly."

8454, Wow!
8455, .@BoredElonMusk
8456," Like, but *with* self-driving haha"
8457," If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.

A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. 

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars."
8458, Yes
8459," Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has “spare” performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.

Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world."
8460," Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd."
8461," I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon."
8462," Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger."
8463," Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster"
8464, Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
8465, ♥️ 🇯🇵
8466," Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. 

Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time."
8467, SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.
8468, We will ask the regulators
8469," Build 8.3 of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week, so that’s roughly when download button should show up"
8470," Assuming user approves warning &amp; agrees to drive carefully, it will download latest QA-tested FSD “Beta” build as soon as car connects to wifi"
8471, Delamain AI cabs should be able to drive themselves when you’re in them &amp; be electric by 2077
8472, … it until you make it
8473," Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp; RVs."
8474,"Starbase, Texas"
8475, It’s all hot air in the end haha
8476," Still many fine details to address, but the final product will be fantastic. There’s nothing else even close."
8477," Haha true. Yet, still, so much dignity is ascribed to horses!"
8478,Carnot efficiency of the Universe?
8479," Ultimately, yes"
8480," Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built."
8481," The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise)."
8482," Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada roads, so harder than it seems."
8483," The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not  ordered as an option."
8484,"Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing. 

Note: word “Beta” is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams."
8485,"Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding “Download Beta” button to Service section of car display in ~10 days"
8486,Doge spelled backwards is Egod
8487, Beta V8.3 has literally ~1000 improvements. Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks.
8488, 🤣🤣
8489, This was way past leg loads. They got squashed hard.
8490,"If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with 8.2 &amp; probably 10X size with 8.3. Still be careful, but it’s getting mature."

8506,March 3rd
8507,Starship launch tomorrow. Window opens at 9am.
8508," Yes, beta will be offered much more widely when version 9 is done, hopefully next month"
8509, FSD beta build V8.1 normally drives me around with no interventions. Next version is a big step change beyond that. Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI. This is not widely known.
8510, You’re welcome
8511, Good point
8512," Ok, let’s figure this out tomorrow. I’m all for exciting video coverage, but we also can’t have the place festooned with cameras."

8545, Absolutely
8546, Fremont shut down for two days (parts shortages) &amp; restarted yesterday
8547," This is not about winning anyone over. We are production-limited. The reason we are making our own cells is to *supplement* max production of suppliers. Even moving at full speed, they cannot build enough cells."
8548, I hope they do! It would be awesome 🤣🤣
8549," Prices in the US (of all goods) don’t include VAT, but it’s usually included in other countries. 

Then there’s import duty &amp; transport costs.

8610," To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. 

However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere. 

Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is “almost”."
8611," Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company."

8660," Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However, if we don’t fail, the cost to end users will improve every year."
8661, SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.
8662," Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered, net of value of any product made.

8710, Yes
8711," Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good."
8712," Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky"

8738, Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
8739," He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage."
8740, That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
8741," Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor"
8742," T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W."

8748, I never used this guy. He gave a talk at SpaceX once.
8749, Only Halo
8751, I sure hope that’s not true at Tesla or SpaceX!
8752," Cryoproof, then install engines"
8753,Starship SN9 &amp; SN10
8754,"In retrospect, it was inevitable"
8755, Great shot
8756," Live by the sword, die by the sword"
8757, Entropy
8758, Buy &amp; hold companies that make goods &amp; produce services you love
8759, Earth is small &amp; we are smaller still
8760, 👀
8761,"With Cyberpunk, even the hotfixes literally have hotfixes, but … great game"
8763, The dollar is shorting itself
8764, Indeed
8765, Shopify is great too. SpaceX used them.
8766, 🤣🤣
8767, Indeed. The economy — making useful products &amp; providing great services — is what actually matters.
8768," TANSTAAFL. Would be better to have small fees than no fees, as latter makes Robinhood beholden to big trading houses. Got to pay the bills somehow. Even Etsy has fees."
8769,"Here come the shorty apologists
Give them no respect
Get Shorty"
8770,"u can’t sell houses u don’t own
u can’t sell cars u don’t own
but 
u *can* sell stock u don’t own!?
this is bs – shorting is a scam
legal only for vestigial reasons"
8771, Yes
8772," Finishing engineering this year, production starts next year. Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp; advanced battery work were important precursors."
8773, I made that video!
8774, Absolutely
8775," Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure. 

Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars."
8776, Nomad
8777, 🤗
8778,The esthetics of Cyberpunk are incredible btw. The interior design is👌.
8779, Major esthetics improvements coming
8780, A little
8781, New Roadster is part rocket
8782, There’s more storage now &amp; easily upgradable
8784, Yes
8785," Yeah, probably in a few months"
8786," After you drive without using a PRND stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back &amp; use a shifter!"
8787," No more stalks. Car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context &amp; nav map. You can override on touchscreen."
8788, A hedge fund that shorts is a shrubbery
8789," Yeah, also a rear screen"
8790,0 to 155mph trap speed in a 1/4 mile. 200mph top speed (with right tires).
8791,First production car ever to achieve 0 to 60 mph in less than 2 seconds
8792,It can play Cyberpunk
8793,Plaid Model S ships next month
8794,Even Discord has gone corpo …
8795, Yup. Wild times on Discord haha.
8797, Waiting for FAA review …
8798,Gamestonk!! 
8799, Passed initial pressure test
8800, Yes
8802,Bought a hand knit wool Marvin the Martian helm for my dog
8804,I kinda love Etsy
8805, It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation
8806, We’re hoping for FAA approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon
8807," Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn  on FSD"
8808, Tesla is steadily moving all NNs to 8 camera surround video. This will enable superhuman self-driving.
8809," [Some tyranny]. Also, the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions."
8810, Catchy!
8811, All sats launched next year will have laser links. Only our polar sats have lasers this year &amp; are v0.9.
8812, Yup
8813, I hope so
8814," These also have laser links between the satellites, so no ground stations are needed over the poles"
8815, Sorry for the version confusion. V8.1 is what it should say for FSD. Separate version number for rest of car.
8816," To my surprise, Tesla has better AI hardware &amp; software than Waymo (money)"
8817, It floats
8818, Fallout-themed opening party for Vegas Loop happening as soon as allowed!
8819, 🤣🤣
8820,Under Vegas in tunnel yesterday with my boys
8821, Lasers
8822, 💯
8823, We’re switching to a more sensible FSD version numbering to distinguish between major &amp; minor updates. Current build is FSD 8.1. It drove me to an unfamiliar location in LA &amp; back last night with no interventions!
8824," Hopefully, early next week"
8825," Given so many other companies are depending on this mission, it is getting even more scrutiny than a Starlink flight"
8826,Launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow. Excited about offering low-cost access to orbit for small companies!
8827," They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. We may need something that’s ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy."
8828," It’s a good path for fully renewable rocket energy, so solves part of problem, but longer chain hydrocarbons than CH4 are needed to be solid at room temp"
8829,Details next week
8830,Am donating $100M towards a prize for best carbon capture technology
8831, Pretty much
8832," That would probably mean civilization is doing great, although depends on assumptions for inflation haha"
8833, He’s everywhere 🤣🤣
8834, Absolutely! They rock. 🖤
8835, The rate-limiting part or process in cell production is constantly changing
8836," Cars &amp; trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases &amp; particulate, but road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic &amp; be an example to the world. 

Spoke with about tunnels last week. If Governor &amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it."
8837," With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made"
8838, Tegmark is an exceptionally smart &amp; good human
8839," The best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries, like food &amp; beverage, some medical (eg syringes) &amp; toys"
8840,Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem.
8841, Looking into this. No question that FSD should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a trade-in.
8842, For sure
8843, Glad you’re ok
8844, Congratulations!
8845, This is a good one
8846, I whistle
8847, Cybertruck doesn’t need a garage
8848, It will be awesome
8849, Good point
8850, Your server-side code is doing too much
8851, Happy birthday Wikipedia! So glad you exist.
8852, Guess you been watching Cobra Kai
8853, Fallout New Texas
8854, Only Chuck Norris can divide by zero
8855, Good point
8856," The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. 

What actually matters is making goods &amp; providing services. 

We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. 

Whichever has least error &amp; latency will win."
8857,Monty Python is amazing
8858, They sure can twist the knife in that show!
8859, Probably wise
8860, We’re making major improvements to ease of engine swap. Needs to be a few hours at most.
8861," Two of the engines need slight repairs, so will be switched out"
8862, Nice shot
8863," We don’t have high school internships, but please apply when you’re in college!"
8864," Prototypes are easy, volume production is hard, positive cash flow is  excruciating"
8865, Physics
8866, Detanking &amp; inspections now. Good progress towards our “Hop in &amp; go to Mars!” goal.
8867,All three static fires completed &amp; no RUDs!
8868," Wow, a lot has happened in 10 years!"
8870, Sea shanty tiktok takes it to a new level with actual pirate ships
8871, Sure
8872,"Today at SpaceX is about practicing Starship engine starts. Ship is held down by massive pins while engines are fired. Two starts completed, about to try a third."
8873, As promised
8874,Legalize comedy
8875, You can steal our name/logos &amp; we probably won’t sue you
8876, We’re just trying to get people to Mars. Help would be appreciated.
8877," One day, we will get a camera up there that also shows the star field in the background"
8878, Suicide is more than double homicide
8879, Absolutely
8880,"Hey you …
Yeah you Queen …
You’re gonna make it! 💕💕"
8881," Hate to say it, but might be true"
8882, The robot future is coming
8883," 300km every millisecond, but there are times I wish it were faster"
8886,Mus protec 👶 yoda
8887, Он был великолепен
8888, This is an important distinction
8889, Much more than this &amp; increasing rapidly
8890, It is
8891," Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined"
8892, The factory is the product
8893, Probably commenting on will do more
8894, I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. They’re great places to get spare parts.
8895, A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech
8896, Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more.
8897," I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesn’t leave time to write books."
8898, 🤣🤣
8899, Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year
8900, The Prancing Pony?
8901, 🤣🤣
8902, 😢
8903, It’s true
8904," Yes, but not for long"
8905," Yeah, they seemed optimistic too"
8906,"My 14-year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like 2021 will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so."
8907, Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time
8908," I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar."
8909, That too
8910," That’s actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory"
8911, And increase fun! Hopefully.
8912, Me neither
8913, One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations
8914," No, but maybe one day"
8915," Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits."
8916, His sick beats
8917," Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three."
8918," Or at least the option for verification, so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts"
8919,Launch underway
8920,"Btw, critical feedback is always super appreciated, as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems)"
8921, Yup
8922," Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O —&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time."
8923," Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but that’s more of a long-term solution."
8924," This will be hard to make, as it isn’t like any other vehicle"
8925, Playing the long game
8926, True
8927," I hope so. Wings don’t work on the moon at all and def not well on Mars. Also, no runways."
8928, Hamiltonians have +2V the potential of Langrangians and a play!
8930," Well, back to work …"
8931, How strange
8932,Use Signal
8933, Ya don’t say. Reminds me of this timeless classic …
8934, Fast water with tiny rocks
8935," Yes, and then Occam’s razor is actually third most likely"
8936,"As seen from an external observer, not the participants"
8937,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely
8938, Dumb and Dumber is a great movie tho
8939,This is called the domino effect
8940, Doesn’t quite illustrate true size difference. Starship payload volume &amp; mass are &gt;1000% that of Shuttle.
8941,"Because of the large footprint, it may seem flat, but actually ranges up to 5 stories tall"
8942,Snow falling on Giga Berlin
8943, Yes
8944, 😉
8945, Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.
8946,"So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all."
8947," Um, we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance"
8948," Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Can’t speak for regulators though."
8949," Dojo isn’t needed, but will make self-driving better. It isn’t enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers."
8950,Ignore the heading
8951,Great interview with Mathias Döpfner
8952, 🎩 The Greatest Gatsby 🎩
8953, Inspired by the ballet
8954," Rocket motion is primarily vertical, so you want the top open"
8955, Let’s make the roaring 20’s again!
8956, Might be a few lumps along the way
8957," Production is hard, prototypes are easy. Building ~1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission."
8958, Exactly
8959, Haha
8960, SN9 will press CH4 header tank with helium. Long-term solution is under debate. Not clear what is lightest/simplest.
8961, Yes
8962," Legs would certainly work, but best part is no part, best step is no step"
8963, Yes
8964, Saves mass &amp; cost of legs &amp; enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount — ready to refly in under an hour
8965," We’re going to try to catch the Super Heavy Booster with the launch tower arm, using the grid fins to take the load"
8966,Snake-head dog had my undivided attention until winder-head ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant
8967, This is very sensible. Opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress everywhere!
8968, Literally
8969, Are we sure this is real?
8970,"Destiny, destiny
No escaping 
that for me"
8971,All Tesla cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the Full Self-Driving option for free. Delivery &amp; docs must be fully complete by midnight Dec 31st.
8972," And Mark Dankberg. This action is wack, not dank!!"
8973, Less?
8974, Westworld
8975,The Last Kingdom show is great
8976," Absolutely. Will be text &amp; visualization, but could add voice too."
8977, !! Even cheese is made of cake !!
8978," If they don’t love us, we’re in deep trouble!"
8979,Not everything is made of cake
8980, True haha
8981,Such a weird game when you think about it
8982,This is not CGI
8983, We need a UI overhaul
8984," No, these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase. FSD build is a fundamental rewrite, not just in the car, but also our video training/labeling software."
8985," Starlink “poses a hazard” to Viasat’s profits, more like it. Stop the sneaky moves, Charlie Ergen!"
8986,Entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves
8987, Just meeting with Larry Ellison to seek some advice. Back working on Tesla end of quarter tomorrow.
8988, Absolutely
8989,What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?
8990, Absolutely
8991, Taste of the future
8992,Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon.
8993," Focus on making products &amp; services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. This is the good future."
8994," Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique — not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus."
8995, Yes
8996, Very important
8997," Ok, service might be able to do this. Will check."
8998, You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don’t have it?
8999," No, but definitely this year"
9000, Good point
9001, Interesting
9002, Liz has always done great interviews
9003," Falcon was 25% of successful orbital launches in 2020, but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. Anyone done the math?"
9004, Vaccines are just the start. It’s also capable in theory of curing almost anything. Turns medicine into a software &amp; simulation problem.
9005, Yes
9006, We will offer multiple display options
9007, A few more revisions needed. Probably Beta 10 or 11.
9008, Sure
9009, Haha ok
9010," There are subtle, important, differences between US &amp; Canada traffic rules, but FSD beta will be extended to Canada very soon"
9011, Yes
9012, We need a “match other traffic speed” setting
9013, Definitely
9014, It’s a step in that direction
9015," It’s one 🔥 or 1/2 🔥 if you don’t have a car with pedestrian speaker. We couldn’t get everything done in time, but more stuff coming."
9016, The writing on Cobra Kai is sick👌
9017, Haha I will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts
9018, You can upload custom music/sounds
9019," Unfortunately, pedestrian speaker is needed, otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn"
9020,"Change your horn sound to 🐐, 🐍🎷, 💨 or holiday jingles with latest Tesla software update!"
9021,Merry Christmas &amp; happy holidays! 🎁
9022, Great game!
9023, It will most likely make sense for Starlink to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable
9024, Yes
9025, A few months
9026, Coming soon
9027, Minor
9028, Yeah
9029,12 story rocket turns off its engines &amp; does a controlled fall
9030," Yup, we’re just ironing out a few bugs"
9031,"To Tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!!"
9032, Frictionless AI. What could possibly go wrong?
9033, Good idea
9034," During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting."
9035," Strange, if true. 

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?"
9036, Sparta’s reply to Macedon
9037, Hi Liz!
9038,Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make Tesla successful. My heart goes out to you.
9039, Indeed
9040," It was a seriously twisted affair, but all’s that ends well."
9041," They are, although it’s kind low-key. Tesla Superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars."
9042, Are such large transactions even possible?
9043,♥️ i love all u crazy ppl out there ♥️
9044, You have a point (sigh)
9045, Great game
9046," Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations &amp; partying with people your own age. Now, even that’s gone."
9047,"Come for the comments, 
stay for the memes💄"
9048, Absolutely. We will release FSD subscription early next year.
9049,One word: Doge
9050,Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money
9051, Great nails &amp; lipstick
9052, Nice
9054, Sounds about right
9055,“Lord” Edge
9056, Nice branding
9057,"Just kidding, who needs a safe word anyway!?"
9058,Bitcoin is my safe word
9059, Standing down for today to inspect rocket. Hopefully launching tomorrow.
9060, Pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Review underway.
9061, I am hoping to be back next month!
9062, Last launch of 2020 coming up
9063," He was indeed quite grumpy, but we did not actually know what we were doing, so he had a point"
9064," It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! There’s some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk … ?"
9065,"Star Light, Star Bright"
9066, This is incorrect
9067, But it is visually stunning &amp; playability is good
9068," A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesn’t make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there weren’t level-based item limits in a single-player game."
9069," I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare"
9070," The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off."
9071," Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines"
9072," It’s a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great"
9073," Perhaps slightly more confident, but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic."
9074, Dankeschön Brandenburg und Grünheide!
9075," Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world’s most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict."
9076," Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great"
9077, The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue:
9078, .@TheBabylonBee
9079,Ascent to the Heavens
9080, 🤣
9081," Yeah, briefly. Seems pretty good. I picked Nomad, so start was a little slow, but picks up fast. Seemed like almost everyone on Steam was playing Cyberpunk at some point this weekend!"
9083,Hehe
9088, init void
9089, *cooling haha
9090," Ship leeward side will be bare metal, windward will have black, hexagonal heat shield tiles"
9091, Yes
9092," Agreed, should be preserved in memory of SN8"
9093, Exactly! Woohoo!!
9094," SN8 did great! Even reaching apogee would’ve been great, so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was epic!!"
9095,"Thank you, South Texas for your support! This is the gateway to Mars."
9096,"Life, the Universe and Everything"
9097," Yeah, engines did great!"
9098,"Mars, here we come!!"
9099,"Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high &amp; RUD, but we got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team hell yeah!!"
9100,"Successful ascent, switchover to header tanks &amp; precise flap control to landing point!"
9101, 🤠
9102, Near-orbital space is the fastest way to travel long distance on Earth!
9103," It’s called the Space “Station”, but it’s actually moving around Earth at ~25 times the speed of sound or ~10 times faster than a rifle bullet"
9104,"“So long, and thanks for the orifice!”
- Alien message decrypted"
9105, Probably 1/3 chance of completing all mission objectives
9106, Hopefully flying tomorrow
9107, Yup
9108,Out on the pad in South Texas
9109," Wow, Station looks amazing!"
9110," Knock, knock, singing telegram!"

9120,Watch Demolition Man
9121,Prometheus Unbound
9122, Not bad
9123, It was a beast compared to the VIC-20
9124," Award accepted on behalf of the great people at Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co"
9125,"Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a “rocket scientist”, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon."
9126,"Science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the Universe, engineering is about creating things that never existed"
9127, It does get a bit cold at night
9128, Paint makes a hell of a difference
9129, Congrats!
9130, Thanks for everything you did to help build SpaceX! Some of the best memories ever.
9131, It will be real soon
9132," Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs."
9133," Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights"
9134, Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.
9135," Yes, very sad news. Tony was great."
9136," For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha"
9137," Yeah, truncate zeros &amp; then round"
9138, Probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks
9139, fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what we’re betting on for training with Dojo
9140, Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great
9141, But actually!
9143,Happy Thanksgiving!
9144, Hopefully next month
9145," Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically."
9146, Haha true
9147, The Promise is greatly needed

9152,"This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal"
9153," Yes, but only slightly filled"
9154, This is a subject of much debate
9155, Major upgrades are slated for SN15
9156," Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc."
9157, But that’s why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
9158," Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance"
9159,"Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip."
9160, Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
9161, Not yet
9162," Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it’s probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull."
9163," Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary"
9164, Yes
9165," We’re still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference."
9166, FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.
9167, Exciting mission!
9168, Wow
9169, Yea
9170,"Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You"
9171, Sure
9172, True
9173, We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point😬.
9174," Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy"
9175, Yes 😃
9176, Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!
9177, Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products
9178, Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.
9179,Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California
9180," Actually, off to the side (so it doesn’t take out the launch mount in bad landing), but with the same arm used to pick up the ship"
9181, Where it should be!
9182," Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise it’d be wrong to ask others to do so."
9183,"Well, almost anything"
9184,Quite the day ahead
9185, Now *this* is what you’d call pointy!
9186, Cool
9187," They’re moving at ~25 times the speed of sound, but it feels like nothing"
9189, There will always be upgrades
9190, It will be better than human vision by quite a margin
9191, Reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. Almost everything except metal is translucent.
9192, Exactly
9193," This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with. 

Just pointless imo for self-driving. If you’re going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm."
9194, One day we will fly you on Starship
9195, Well done!
9196," I can’t comment on turbopump internal details, but you’re roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist."
9197," To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this."
9198," Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej."
9199, Yeah. They stole Apple’s code too.
9200, They have an old version of our software &amp; don’t have our NN inference computer
9201, Wild times!
9202, Congrats!
9203, .@TheOnion
9204, Yup
9205," Change out a few parts, otherwise fine"
9206, Caution strongly advised with SPACs
9207, Sure
9208, Haha sexy cropping champion of all time
9209," If next week’s release looks good, we will widen beta"
9210," Unfortunately, there are too many rules around liquor distribution, even in the US. However, we will be selling the lightning bottle &amp; shot glasses worldwide."
9211, 13 years &amp; $11 billion … wow
9212, Safety is our primary design goal
9213, Fully
9214, Let the Martians decide their own future
9215, A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units!
9216," Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization – discovering our ruins – will be impressed humans got that far."
9217, That is certainly the intention!
9219, The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla
9220," Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products &amp; services. They have no point in &amp; of themselves, nor do these indices. Buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you don’t."
9221," No, just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL."
9222," Life in glass domes at first. Eventually, terraformed to support life, like Earth."
9223, Yeah
9224," I was going to say “Sim!”, but that seemed too obvious haha"
9225, Deveras!
9226," And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether they’re just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious."
9227, Maybe a little Mercy …
9228,Tesla holiday software release is 🔥🔥
9229, 😏
9230,Cobra Kai is a deep cut
9231, It’s all cake &amp; someone took a bite
9232, There is such a thing as too much sentience
9233,Deus ex machine learning
9234," It’s designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity! 

Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. Necessary, for a city on Mars."
9235, More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.
9236,Nullius in Verba
9237, Indeed
9238, Dojo/Doge
9239," Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it’s mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year"
9240, Exactly
9241," Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. 

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen."
9242," Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!"
9243," Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn’t matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold."
9244, Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.
9245," Pretty close. Definitely feel 💯 if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I’ve ever had."
9246, Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
9247, The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don’t blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
9248, We should just count the atoms at this point
9249," Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain."
9250, Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn’t work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.
9251, Maybe *I* just love irony haha
9252," They’re on their way! Hopefully, more Teslaquila next month."
9253, Special permission received from Stonecutters Guild!
9254, Fate 🖤 Irony
9255, Well said.
9256, 👻 💵 
9257," Damn, that’s not easy! I spent quite a bit of time looking at Russian/Ukrainian engines. They’re good."
9258, Yes
9259, 🎶 Toss a bitcoin to ur Witcher 🎶
9260, 😉
9261," CureVac, Moderna &amp; a few others. Tesla makes the machine CureVac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipid-coated mRNA strands."
9262, Haha
9263, Great thread
9264," I’m ok, thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days, apart from fatigue. Unless something changes, would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold."
9265,♥️
9266,Launch in 5 minutes
9267," Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls"
9268,"The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other"
9269,"Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety"
9270,"Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety"
9271," Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. I’ve had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over."
9272," Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this."
9273," Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument"
9274,Astronaut launch today!
9275, No kids though
9276, Hell of a wig collection too
9277, It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
9278,Worth reading this thread if you’re curious about rona testing
9279," They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it’s high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes “positive”."
9280," A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks."
9281," In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I’m asking the wrong question, what is a better question?"
9282," Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged."
9283," Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold."
9284, Ahem
9285,Unless you’re on DMT
9286,"Laws of thermodynamics:
1. You can’t win
2. You can’t break even
3. You can’t stop playing"
9287,Shakes fist at entropy
9288, Big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 weeks!
9289," Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 &amp; N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of today’s test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results."
9290, What’s honey?
9291, Feels that way
9292, This seems accurate
9293, Cold symptoms are gone for now 😀🚀💫
9294, There are degrees of pos
9295, Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford 🤣🤣. General public doesn’t realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
9296," The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?"
9297, This a great reference! Worth a read.
9298,Case closed
9299,Soon
9300," Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere."
9301," Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable."
9302," Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max."
9303, Strange
9304," Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu."
9305, From
9306, Sure is
9307,"Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?"
9308, Interesting
9309, Interesting
9310,What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
9311," A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer. 

False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic:"
9312," Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil."
9313," Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin."
9314,The carousel turns ever faster
9315, Yup
9316, Exactly
9317, Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
9318," If it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours."
9319,"Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD."
9320," Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines."
9321, Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
9322," We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it’s going to pop the cork."
9323, 🤣🤣👍
9324,4 Astronauts fly to on Sat night from Cape. First operational flight of Crew Dragon.
9325, Luck is the best superpower
9326, Yes
9327, It is an honor that they would choose to work with me. I strive to ensure that the companies enable creative &amp; driven people to reach their potential.
9328,Such a privilege to work with people I like &amp; respect so much. I feel blessed.
9329, Probably
9330, Happy to see this :)
9331," I do expect this to become an important product for the world, but probably not financially material for Tesla"
9332, There’s no entry/braking burn &amp; hypersonic angle of attack is ~70 degrees
9333, Tesla makes the RNA Bioreactor that can make vaccines / cures. CureVac has version 2 in use. Version 3 is under development.
9334, Checking
9335, I just hope this game doesn’t twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled
9337,"Yes, you can have my damn cookie! should be a browser setting"
9338, Thanks to a lot of great Autopilot/AI hardware &amp; software engineers at Tesla!
9339, For sure
9340, Will be worth it
9341, Exactly
9342, Sure
9343," Actually, it’s still there"
9344, Wait until you see what Cybertruck will do
9345, This is accidental. Will be back shortly.
9346, Am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no legs. Will require extreme precision.
9347, Chip has temp sensor &amp; automatically maintains safe temp
9348, Enough already on my plate &amp; Tesla’s. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is 100X harder.
9349," Neuralink won’t overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output, especially latter."
9350," We rewrote all labeling software for 4D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo won’t contribute for about a year. It’s mostly a generalized NN training computer, but benchmark we’re tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or it’s pointless."
9351, Version 1 is about a year away
9352, It would appear that their calculations were incorrect
9353, China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over.
9354, ♠️♠️ Tesla Autopilot/AI team ♠️♠️
9355," Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. Frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important."
9356,"The Phantom of the Opera 
Is here … inside your mind"

9360,"A New Banner is needed
Neither hard left nor right"
9361, Another fine day in the simulation …
9362," Faraday invented the electric motor, Tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) AC induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor"
9363," Maxwell was amazing. Should have more recognition. Tesla Motors, Inc., was almost called Faraday, as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995."
9364,420 is ten times better than 42
9365,🤗
9366, Awaiting approval from Canadian authorities
9367,Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to 25Guns@Tesla.com.
9368, Stop being a chad
9369, Uh … Chad wtf
9370," Einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried)"
9371," Yeah, that will be relatively easy, as so few users out in the ocean"
9372," Yes, although I didn’t expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that they’re needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years."
9373," Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later."
9374, Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.
9375," I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt."
9376," That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didn’t own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time."
9377, Yes
9378," Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge"
9379," As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year."
9380," Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!"
9381, Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
9382, Didn’t realize that was possible. No problem if there’s a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
9383," As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March."
9384,Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
9385, New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.
9386, Haha
9387,Very close to actual expected flight!
9388," I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said, while it is considerably larger, I don’t think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering."
9389," Sure, maybe in a month or so"
9390," Well, it’s basically a tank from the future that’s road-legal, so yeah"
9391, Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.
9392, Yes
9393,Penguin Random House 😴 should change the name to Random Penguin🔥
9394," Sure, although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong, but we’ll provide video, warts &amp; all. You will see every frame that we do."
9395, This is what matters most
9396," We’ve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass"
9398, Lord of the …
9399," Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater."
9400, Minor
9401," But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready."
9402," Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win."
9403, Every 5 to 10 days
9404," Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human"
9405," We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience."
9406," Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! 

Doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing. Reality is the hardest sim."
9407, Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
9408, This build should be noticeably better with interventions
9409, Yes
9410," I’ve spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem. 

Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement."
9411, And … Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct 29
9412," True. Also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity."
9413," Now we’re talking. Also, Stephenson 2-18 is in the constellation Scrotum haha."
9414, Accurate
9416, Some challenges with high winds. Looks like Sunday for static fire.

9439, FEAR 2 is best imo. Also Dead Space 2. They will haunt your dreams.
9441," To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades. 

Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.

GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories."
9442," All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life."
9443, And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
9444, Bettern nothin or ur 💰 back!

9452, Critical to humanity’s future
9453,Congratulations SpaceX Team!
9454, Mine is a few days ahead
9455," Sure, it could be an option in settings"
9456, Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
9457, Sure
9458," I’m in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see."
9459, Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
9460, Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
9461," Yup. With beta updates, there’ll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast."
9462, Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
9463, Starship is coming together!
9464,Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
9465, There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
9466," Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?"
9467, Agreed. Are these performance tires?
9468," Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case."
9469, Sure
9470,"Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday"
9471," As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human)."
9472, Yes
9473, Haha
9474, Dependent on proving high safety
9475," Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt)."
9476," Cold gas for now, hot later"
9477," I mean, ya gotta have a tiki bar …"
9478,"Starship nosecone, high bay &amp; tiki bar"
9479, …
9480, After it gets to orbit a few times
9481, Got a little melty tbh :)
9482," Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn’t achieve anything, but I’m confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights."
9483," Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. 

R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps."
9484,"FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should."
9485,Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
9486, Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
9487, Sweden at zero deaths Oct 15
9488, Yes
9489," Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes"
9490," Mobi-C has too much mobility, fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha."
9491," Actually, it’s my neck …"
9492," Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely."
9493, Pretty accurate. It’s not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code &amp; inform immune system what to attack.
9494, London to Beijing would be cool
9495," Wow, that would be quite a trip!"
9496, That’s my kid haha
9497,møtør trèndé
9498, Looks like snoopy
9499, Current production is slightly better
9500, Doesn’t seem to be any life in this solar system. Maybe under the ice of Europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of Mars. Worth reading:
9501, Very creative
9502, That free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts ~4 million tons of mass into energy every second. We just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization.
9503, You never know
9504, After
9505, 😢
9506," Also, system should autodelete old data automatically by default"
9507, Table in tension
9508, Yes
9509," Starting production on 7 seater next month, initial deliveries early December"
9510,"The gauntlet has been thrown down! 

The prophecy will be fulfilled. 

Model S price changes to $69,420 tonight!"
9511, More great renderings! Significant improvements coming to the welds.
9512, Congratulations!
9513, Making progress
9514,9 meter or roughly 30 ft diameter
9515,Will be less roomy with 3 vacuum rocket engines added
9516," It’s still there, but focus is Vegas &amp; Prufrock, our new tunneling machine"
9517, For sure
9518, Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations.
9519," We simplified this a lot. It’s basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds."
9520, Sweet …
9521, Yes. Everything is slow to a phased array antenna.
9522, Nice
9523,“What is love? Baby don’t hurt me.”— Winston Churchill
9524, Or maybe 2 weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom
9525, Please buff Torb’s turret!
9526, Um … yes
9527, I have Goosebumps 2 merch. Not sure how tbh.
9528, HG2G
9529, LotR
9530,🤘 The Illuminaughty 🤘
9531, Knee deep
9532, Yeah
9533, At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time!
9534," Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but he’s in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy."
9535," Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It’s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian."
9536," With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it’s right."
9537," Thank you, much more accurate haha"
9538, This graph appears to be upside down
9539," Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual."
9540, Will release order configurator probably in Jan
9541," Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers."
9542," The SoC’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant"
9543," Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails."
9544," Accurate analysis. Quite a few 
ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements."
9545, !
9546, Glad Jen is safe!
9547, Wow
9548," Uh ok, here we go …"
9549, I don’t think this is accurate
9550," Even if half that amount, it’s still a big deal!"
9551, 🤣🤣
9552, I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count!
9553," We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build."
9554, Definitely
9555," Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent."
9556," There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO."
9557," When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all."
9558, Interesting
9559, SpaceX/Tesla metallurgy &amp; new materials team is next-level
9560, I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!
9561," Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo."
9562, Sweden was right
9563," There are sensitive elements, but they’re on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I’ve posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer!"
9564, Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
9565, It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
9566, Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
9567," Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user."
9568, I’m proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
9569, Norway leads the world
9570, Passed cryo proof
9571, 👍
9572," Yeah, it’s not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing, but casting doesn’t work well for complex enclosed volumes &amp; high strength or high temp alloys."
9573, Great pics!
9574, Maybe this should be the flag of Mars
9575," Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. 

It’s already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive."
9576," Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note"
9577, Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD.
9578, It should be
9579, Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
9580," Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz 🤣"
9581, Yes
9582," Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler"
9583," Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks."
9584," Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%"
9585," Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster."
9586, Mimecraft
9587, Yes
9588, Autopilot team is making great progress. Reality sure is complicated!
9589," Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake"
9590, We do have giant steel balls haha
9591," We just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one"
9592, I definitely need to try these tasty cakes &amp; pastries on my next visit!
9593," Mass ratio. Liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid methane, even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point."
9594, Had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of Tacheles. Too bad that place got torn down. It was awesome.
9595, döner kebab
9596, You’re most welcome!
9597, High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
9598, That looks tasty!
9599, The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
9600, Sandy Munro understands engineering
9601," That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one."
9602," Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product"
9603," Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough."
9604, But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
9605, Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
9606," The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three."
9607," Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly."
9608, Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
9609," Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part."
9610, We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
9611," Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system. 

Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven."
9612, They are
9613, I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
9614," 7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. We’ll hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest."
9615," Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking"
9616, One of the best shots ever!
9617, Much sooner
9618, Great photo!
9619, It will soon
9620, We’re not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
9621, Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
9622," Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year."
9623,4th flight &amp; landing for this booster
9624,5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
9625," So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe."
9626," It’s a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market."
9627,"Turn volume to 11 &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla 
"
9628, FSD will solve these issues
9629,"Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11, because it’s louder than 10
"
9630," One of my favorite writers. Foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential."
9631, 💯
9633,Rewatched Young Frankenstein this weekend. Still awesome. Ovaltine?
9634," The remake has the potential to be great. I kinda liked the original tbh, but it’s possible to take it up a level."
9635,"Hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original, because financials"
9636, This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10X long-term
9637," Pretty wild, considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago"
9638,New SpaceX droneship will be called “A Shortfall of Gravitas”
9639,"Nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!)"
9640, Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while it’s driving
9641, Coming soon
9642,"Call of Booty, great game"
9644, Vector-space bird’s eye view coming with FSD
9645, Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
9646," All of that and more. We’re doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range &amp; regulatory constraints this weekend. I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person."
9647, Exactly
9648, We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!
9649, I agree with Lex
9650, Glad you’re ok!
9651, Haha
9652, Thanks for waiting!
9653, Next year for sure
9654," Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes."
9655, High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
9656, Great
9657," Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity — needs several more Starlink launches. I’m using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet."
9658," Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As we’re able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero."
9659, Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
9660," Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming"
9661," Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn’t required for Mars, so 4 is possible"
9662," Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged"
9663, Yeah
9664," Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we’re actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded."
9665," The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling."
9666, It’s next-level
9667, 💰💩🤣
9668, Glad to hear your Mom is ok
9669, Good to see. Inspiring for future of space!
9670, The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
9671," Yes, coming soon"
9672, Great render! The circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
9673, That’s very hard to do. Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? It’s designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic.
9674," It’s cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)"
9675, Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships
9676, Haha true. Why do showers have such a wide range!?
9677, !!
9678, Yes
9679, Light is not as fast as you’d think
9680, Maybe we used too many magenta spotlights
9681, Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
9682," We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. I’m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it."
9683, Fate loooves irony haha
9684, Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
9685, True
9686," That’s total market, not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030, but that requires consistently excellent execution."
9687, Total market
9688," Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials."
9689, Both will do original cars
9690, We aren’t cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3.
9691," What about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?"
9692, New version coming soon
9693," Suppliers. We’re only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasn’t clear that we’ve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard."
9695," If it passes Australian regulations, then sure"
9696, 🤣🤣
9697, Checking into it
9698," Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool"
9699, Completely agree
9700," Yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics."
9701,"Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics."
9702, There are times when I feel like I’m living in a Dilbert cartoon
9703, That species has stood the test of time
9704," Mostly 304L, some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also, we’re making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture."
9705," 8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It’s enough. Improvements in work."
9706," We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach."
9707,"First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft"
9708,Nosecone &amp; front flaps next week. SN9 next month.
9709,Starship SN8 with rear body flaps
9711, Sure
9712, True
9713, Not bad
9714, Exactly
9715, Sandy Munro understands engineering
9716, Turns out they mostly press the letter s &amp; 💩 on the typewriter 🤣
9717,Centaur with a bow obviously
9718, Haha
9719, Something like this
9720, Can’t support 3 wheel vehicles. Not safe enough.
9721, ~9007mm
9722," Something appealing about Hawking/Hartle idea, but I agree with Turok/Feldbrugge/Lehners"
9723, 🖤 ur algo
9724, True
9725," There are some practical size constraints too. Can’t be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice."
9726," Doesn’t seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure."
9727," Preburners ignite, then main chamber"
9728, Where is our prediction of probability inaccurate?
9729," Or energy &amp; time, but besides that what?"
9730, Genetic engineering is too slow unless you use a synthetic virus
9731,What can’t we predict?
9732," Yeah, but might not need it"
9733, 107 expansion ratio. You can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle.
9734,Only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
9735, This does seem like the opposite of open. OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.
9736, Haha true
9737, Maybe I will …
9738, Jets are so cool
9739, Pretty much
9740, Yes
9741, Yahoo Finance is as dumb as it sounds
9742, Yes
9743, Haha
9744, Roadster will be better
9745,"Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster &amp; Semi
C A R S"
9746, Thanks for your many years of support through very tough times!
9747," We will be a little below that this year (most challenging year we’ve ever had), but probably above that next few years"
9748, That’s about right. Maybe a little faster.
9749, Yes
9750, cgi irl
9751, Haha
9752,"The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself."
9753, Haha
9754,"We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves."
9755,"Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022."
9756, Thanks!
9757, We really need better legs for Starship. They’re coming.
9758," Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend."
9759," Fine, we’ll do it already 😀"
9760," Good analysis, although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature"
9761, I’m pretty sure Tesla could do a much better autocorrect. The bar is so low haha.
9762, True
9763, Custom ultra high speed bus &amp; efficient cooling
9764, Pretty much any machine-learning
9765, It’s big
9766, Sure
9767," Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs"
9768," There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision."
9769," Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world."
9770, You really want waypoints this much?
9771," For Dojo, we’re betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great."
9772, Yes
9773," There’ll be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. The “open” areas inside are covered. They’re internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building."
9774, Shaped like a diamond &amp; aligned on true north
9775,"A prior track record of exceptional achievement in engineering *is* required, but *no* prior experience working on the brain or human physiology is required. We will teach you what’s known about the brain, which is not much tbh."
9776,"If you feel Neuralink might have incorrectly overlooked your resume or declined to  make an offer, please lmk in comment below"
9777, Felt I had done enough on the Internet (Zip2 &amp; PayPal) that my work would be useful to others. Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy &amp; making life multiplanetary.
9778, It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX &amp; Tesla success probabilities above ~zero
9779," To be frank, in the early days, I thought there was &gt;90% chance that both SpaceX &amp; Tesla would be worth $0. The press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me."
9780, Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers
9781,of course I still love you
9782," Sure, but which planet?"
9783, Good movie
9784, Current was too strong for droneship to hold station. Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions.
9785, Lot has happened in 13 years
9786, It will be very insane
9787,Speedrunning Factorio in real life …
9788," No, but you make some great points. Important to note that iron’s cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem."
9789, Yup
9790,Fallout Shelter is on your Tesla. Tap the Entertainment button.
9791, Great idea!
9792,🖤 Fallout Radio  🖤
9793, There are some eerie parallels between The Boring Company &amp; Vault-Tec. We also built our first demonstration tunnel/vault in LA.
9794,Doubles as an underground nuclear shelter 😀👍
9795, Yeah
9796, Should be happening soon

9802,"Tunnels under cities with self-driving electric cars will feel like warp drive

First operational tunnel under Vegas almost done

The"
9803, For sure
9804, Good point
9805,Have you hugged a tunnel today?
9806, Good analysis
9807, Exactly
9808," Gary the snail is still winning, but we’re gaining on him/her"
9809,Embrace tunnels!
9810," Tunnels are the solution to traffic. You can have as many levels as you want. Usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings, so would work even for New York or Beijing."
9811," Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We’ll build several ships just to improve the production system."
9812," Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration."
9813, Couldn’t agree more — major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming
9814," Definitely not. Smartwatches &amp; phones are yesterday’s technology, Neuralinks are the future."
9815, Seems like they should make a whole outfit out of that material
9816, Ancient Greece had it all &amp; then committed suicide. Nobody digs your grave better than yourself.
9817, True
9818, The LEGO Movie was awesome
9819," The Story of Civilization. First book is a little dry, but second book, The Life of Greece, is incredible."
9820, I’m wearing your F-1 engine shirt right now!
9821, Cumulative mass to orbit per year (corrected for GTO &amp; other high energy orbits) is the best comparative metric imo
9822, That’s the number that really matters
9823, Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles?
9824,"One way or another, excitement guaranteed! Support of greater Boca, Padre, Brownsville community is very much appreciated."
9825,"SN8 Starship with flaps &amp; nosecone should be done in about a week. Then static fire, checkouts, static fire, fly to 60,000 ft &amp; back."
9826, Can someone do a boat service from South Padre to Boca?
9827, Exactly. Problems like that have been addressed.
9828, Yes. Good insight.
9829," All frames stitched to single frame (tricky, as all cameras overlap in different ways) &amp; then creating video segments for labeling &amp; training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten."
9830, Much
9831, Yes
9832," Releasing private beta in 2 to 4 weeks, public beta (early access owners who opt in) 4 to 6 weeks after that, then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks."
9833, And this still isn’t using the dramatically better “4D” (aka simultaneous surround video from 8 cameras) architecture
9834, Cool
9835, He has no clue
9836, Sorry to hear that. I’m sure you’ll figure it out though. Took us four launches to reach orbit. Rockets are hard.
9837,Many exciting things will be unveiled on Battery Day 9/22 ⚡️
9838, We will make super efficient home hvac with hepa filters one day
9839," If Reich actually cares about global warming, why is he making so much hot air!?"
9840, 🇩🇪 Natürlich 🇩🇪
9841,Bitte arbeiten Sie bei Tesla Giga Berlin! Es wird super Spaß machen!!
9842, Try a Tesla &amp; you’re welcome to give it back if you decide you prefer a Subaru
9843, Vera Rubin Observatory is cool
9844, 1+1=2
9845, Munger is right
9846, Black-Scholes formula is kinda bs. Big difference between a finance approximation &amp; fundamental physics / pure math.
9847, True
9848," Tesla is best understood as a collection of about a dozen startups, mostly in series, increasingly in parallel. Every product line &amp; new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else, create new pieces."
9849, Tesla R&amp;D productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent
9850,Tesla Model S &amp; X have hospital-grade (HEPA) air filters. 3 &amp; Y are really good too. This has a big effect on health.
9851, !
9852, Touché
9853," All Tesla workers also get stock, so their compensation increased proportionately. You are a modern day moron."
9854, Yup
9855, 13
9856," Rawlinson didn’t design Model S. Prototype was done before he joined &amp; he left us in the lurch just as things got tough, which was not cool. He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering, but not to powertrain, battery, electronics or software."
9857, We’re pretty close to the manufacturing size limit for a milled copper &amp; steel jacket nozzle. Lot of complexity to add a nozzle extension to a sea level engine for small gain. Also hard to fit bigger engine nozzles on the booster.
9858,A la guerre comme à la guerre
9859, Haha
9860, And starts tweeting
9861,"If you bombard Earth with enough photons, eventually it emits a Tesla (AK)"
9862, There is already bidirectional communication between human &amp; AI via phones &amp; computers. It’s just lossy &amp; very slow (especially output)
9863, Above 50% likely to make it
9864, This is a test engine. Flight articles are fixed with no gimbal.
9865, Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for 380+ sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372.
9866, Yes
9867, Chart understates lithium-ion potential by roughly 1/3
9868,Model 3 rated as most reliable car
9869,Turns out you can make anything fly haha
9870, Exactly. This is not fully appreciated.
9871," Starship SN6 flew asimilar hop to SN5, but it was a much smoother &amp; faster operation"
9872,"🇩🇪🖤Giga Berlin Mannschaft🖤🇩🇪
Vielen Dank für Ihre hervorragende Arbeit an Giga Berlin!!"
9873,Great trip to Germany. Support from government &amp; people is super appreciated!
9874, 🤣🤣
9875, Trust ur butt haha
9876, An AI with 🍓 picking as its goal will result in Strawberry Fields Forever
9877," Over time, outer 20 will have ~300 tons of thrust &amp; inner 8 ~210, so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship"
9878, Yeah
9879, Just go through resonant modes fast. It’s when you hang out there that problems arise.
9880, Videodrome
9883, Yeah
9884, LHC tbh
9886," If you ever want to build a long accelerator tunnel, straight or circular, I know some people …"
9887, Cool
9888," Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation"
9889," If some company has solved a useful thing that we can just buy, that would be great! It’s so much work to create our own tech. We develop new tech, because we have to, not because we want to."
9890," Tesla Germany designed &amp; built the vaccine RNA printers for CureVac, but, subject to some CureVac IP, they could be made for other companies too"
9891," Technically, James Watt measured a pony, added 50% &amp; rounded up haha"
9892," Also, Critical Thinking"
9893, Alexander and the Rise of Hellenism and Film Studies
9894," Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind."
9895," Yeah, he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at Caltech/CERN. Very basic stuff."
9896, It’s too embarrassing
9897,Just learned that my physics prof from Penn is head of Fermilab &amp; still has some of my old homework ☺️
9898," It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas &amp; underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard."
9899," People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect."
9900, That &amp; Giga Berlin are why I’m headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas.
9901," Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells"
9902, Yeah
9903," One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was."
9904," Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn’t blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval."
9905, Not yet
9906, Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
9907," People read too much into this level of detail. It’s not useful for predicting the future, nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term, fine-grained level."
9908, Critical feedback is always appreciated btw
9909," We can’t have a blanket pass, but maybe for some events"
9910, Later versions of a larger device would have that potential
9911, Yup
9912," Actually C, although the syntax could be improved esthetically"
9913," I like C, because it avoids class warfare"
9914, A nightcap would probably work best
9915, Pretty much
9916, Good summary
9917,Conceptual telepathy
9918,Ahem … starting soon
9919,"“All of physics is either impossible or trivial. It is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial.” E Rutherford"
9920, Giant gap between experimental medical device for use only in patients with extreme medical problems &amp; widespread consumer use. This is way harder than making a small number of prototypes.
9921, Testing with shorter RVac skirt went well. Full length skirt test coming soon.
9922,Neuralink product demo in 3 hours. Webcast at
9923, Only need 2 engines
9924, Boring Co tunnel in Vegas is only a few months from being operational
9925," Neuralink this month &amp; Tesla next month, SpaceX probably October. We will have made a lot of progress by then. Might have a prototype booster hop done by then."
9926, Soon
9927, They’re quite accurate!
9928, That number sure comes up a lot 🤣🤣
9929, I’m fine with reasonable drone footage. Just needs to be at a fair distance &amp; not coming right up to people. I think our security was a little overzealous in this case.
9930, Thanks to a smart and hardworking team at Tesla. These sure are wild times …
9931, Much appreciated. This was a serious attack.
9932, Brave Starhopper carried the day
9933, Only so many days
9934," We were too obtuse for our own good, although I think it works esthetically. Those are folded-over current collectors at the top/bottom of the cell, which are important, but I don’t want to jump the gun on Sept 22 …"
9935," But actually nothing. Was surprised to hear they’re across the road. Adding silicon to carbon anode makes sense. We already do. Question is just what ratio of silicon to carbon &amp; what shape? Silicon expands like crazy during discharge &amp; comes apart, so cycle life is usually bad."
9936, Nothing 👀
9937, Then they leave the house and hardly ever call their parents!
9938,"The Big Bang started very, very smōl"

9943, Tesla brake lights are powered by a miniverse inside a microverse
9944, Exactly
9945," No, we’re focused on developing new products &amp; scaling production"

9949, Astronaughty
9950, No
9951," Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day."
9952," Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That’s probably faster."
9953, Now I want candy
9954, There’s a lot of frozen CO2 &amp; H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. It’s solvable.
9955, Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
9956, It’s almost working reliably
9957," Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately."
9958, Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
9959, No &amp; not possible at this scale
9960, Orbital launch mount
9961," Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise."
9962, Sure
9963, On it
9964," I tried to warn them, but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!"
9965," 400 Wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably 3 to 4 years."
9966," Starship/Super Heavy, which is ~10X mass of Zenit, will mostly launch from ocean spaceports long-term"
9967, Starship/Super Heavy is ~10X bigger in mass &amp; volume
9968,A metaphor for life
9969," Accurate distance calculation using only vision is fundamental. Other sensors can help, but are not fundamental."
9970, Uh oh
9971,More fun games coming soon to ur Tesla
9972, strikes again!

9988,Medical check is A-ok!
9989,He might run for President in 2024
9990, Yes
9991, Yes
9992, Absolutely needs liquid cooling. We’re applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
9993," That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease."
9994, We will push for ten flights with Starlink
9995," Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine."
9996," Mostly for employees, but we’ll support public access whenever it’s safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary."
9997, Absolutely 😃 🏝
9998," I don’t want be cavalier, but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine."
9999," I’ve been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though."
10000, Dojo V1.0 isn’t done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
10001, Scorcher VI
10002, Yes
10003," It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!"
10004," Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you’re roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3"
10005," Yes, it will have huge nuts haha"
10006," We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!"
10007," My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut."
10008, Yes
10009,"Aloha, welcome back from space 💫"
10010," Yeah, will post shortly"
10011, Winning “worst person I’ve ever worked with” is not easy. Some real champions are vying for that title!
10012,Ms Tree catches fairing in her net
10013, 😐
10014," Up there somewhere, cruising through deep space"
10015, Must be aliens
10016, Yes
10017, This little spit of dirt will take us to Mars
10018, Humans are swiftly becoming a small percentage of total compute
10019," Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so they’re actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound."
10020, 💨
10021, That’s engine SN. We’re building SN8 of the ship.
10022," SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force."
10023,Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding!
10024," Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We’ll do lots of flights."
10025," Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; there’ll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing."
10026, This might sting a little …
10027, The “early investor” part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years.
10028," Also, there could be long period comets that intersect Earth right now. We just haven’t observed them during humanity’s (very short) recorded history. Comet S-L 9 punched a roughly Earth-sized hole in Jupiter."
10029, Pretty much
10030,Cybertruck option package
10031, Wow

10045, Cover of Barbie Girl
10046, Yes. Probably more accurate to say Great Filters plural.
10047," Yes, it’s called Cyber Girl"
10048,We must pass The Great Filter
10049,Sounds right
10050, Seriously
10051, Crysis rocks

10053," Metal has a fudge-like consistency near its melting point, so you can just smoosh it together"
10054, This is how we make Falcon 9
10056," This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of 10 billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators."
10057, 🤣🤣 hasty govt 🤣🤣
10058," A lot of work remains. Technically, we have it working in sim with FPGAs at ~0.01% capability. This will be a true supercomputer."
10059, Dojo is still being built. Maybe a year or so from V1.0.
10060," Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not."
10061, Your insights over the years have been excellent. That’s approximately right.
10062," Absolutely, but it doesn’t seem that govt can move fast enough"
10063, Ok
10064, It will blow ur mind haha
10065," I want to do electric vtol supersonic sooo bad, but my brain will overload"
10066," Asteroid impact risk is well understood, but not comets. Those worry me."
10067,Great mission patch design!
10068, Haha true
10069, Yup
10070, Exactly
10071," Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didn’t have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily."
10072," Sorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now."
10073," Yes! We’re labeling bumps &amp; potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so."
10074, This is what I meant by “4D”
10075," The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it’s a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks."
10076,Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It’s a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting.
10077, More software improvements coming
10078," Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling &amp; ride comfort &amp; enable user customization of height &amp; damping, geocoded for relevance."
10079," H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel"
10080, What are the odds … ?
10081," The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point."
10082, Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
10083, SN8
10084, Impressive
10085, Psyche
10086," Yes, integrated with the tip of the nose"
10087, This is important
10088, Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term.
10089, Starship fairing will actually have more height than shown here. Dome will be flatter &amp; more of tip is accessible. Usable volume ~1000 cubic meters.
10090, You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
10091, So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
10092, Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once &amp; then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd …
10093, I generally try my best not to be on patents
10094," Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; “space power”. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money."
10095," Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails."
10096, Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?
10097, No surprise
10098, Aiming to make it super fun!
10099, A little toastier each flight
10100," Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion &amp; body bending."
10101,SN7 will be new alloy test tank taken to burst pressure. SN8 will have body flaps &amp; nosecone.
10102,SN 5 &amp; 6 at Starship Production Complex in Texas
10103," One day soon, I will wear this outfit"
10104, I was trying to channel Herb Tarlek from WKRP
10105, Note the fabulous plaid jacket &amp; gingham shirt combo 🤣
10106, Twin Peaks
10107, Working on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan at age 17. I think we did a barn-raising that day.
10109," Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg &amp; other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple &amp; easy — many per day."
10110, Clearly
10111, Also true
10112, 🤣🤣
10113," Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of 3."
10114, I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
10115," And why aim your attacks at Tesla, when we’re doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news?"
10116, That bs was pushed by oil &amp; gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil!
10117, 🎯
10118," Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies."
10119, 💯
10120," Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short"
10121," Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height."
10122, I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
10123, It will look crazy tall with booster &amp; fairing at 122m / 394 ft
10124, Ok
10125," Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize), they were right"
10127,Good piece on Giga Berlin construction
10128, This seems increasingly likely
10129, This is gonna be great
10130,SN5
10131," We’ll do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps"
10132, Soon
10133," V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider &amp; taller — like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces &amp; auto-leveling."
10134, Progress is accelerating
10135, Exactly
10136, Mars is looking real
10137, Possible flight in 3 mins
10138, Most likely
10139, True
10140, Highly likely down the road
10141, True fact
10142," Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didn’t open, triggering an automatic abort. We’ll figure out why &amp; retry tomorrow."
10143, I’m in the Boca control room. Hop attempt in ~33 minutes.
10144, For sure
10145," Tbh, I must confess to occasionally pontificating about high-concept things"
10146, Pretty much
10147," Nosecone closing is recommended, but not required, for safe entry"
10148,"When space travel becomes as common as air travel, the future of civilization will be assured"

10150,Congratulations &amp; on completing first crewed Dragon flight!! 🇺🇸 returned.
10151,Dragon is stable in the water
10152,Acquisition of signal expected in 5 mins
10153,4 mins to Dragon loss of signal due to atmospheric entry plasma
10154,Coming in hot
10155,Astronauts land in 2 hours
10156," However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover"
10157," All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes."
10158, Great game
10159, The simplest solution is not necessarily the most satisfying
10160,🧙‍♂️
10161, Absolutely. Long-lasting art is incredibly difficult.
10162,This BBC article provides a sensible summary for how it was done
10163,"The Great Pyramid was the tallest structure made by humans for 3800 years. Three thousand, eight hundred years. "
10164, So true
10165,Ramses II was 😎
10166,Aliens built the pyramids obv
10167, Ancient Egypt had an incredible esthetic that stands to this day
10168, ☺️
10169, Witch logic
10170," Things we take for granted, like flying, would have had you burned at the stake for witchcraft not that long ago"
10171, Lo Que Construimos
10172, Cool
10174,Starship SN5 just completed full duration static fire. 150m hop soon.
10175,🖤🧛‍♀️Total Eclipse of the Heart 🧛‍♀️🖤
10176, 😮
10177, Not that I’m aware of
10178, Yes. Could also extend range of hearing beyond normal frequencies and amplitudes. Deus Ex.
10179," Neuralinks are currently meant for mature brains &amp; functionality is lost if removed. Rewiring of neurons is certainly possible, but won’t make up for loss of the Link."
10180," Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups &amp; restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device."
10181, Will show neurons firing in real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix.
10182, They don’t fire all at once. Some go several seconds to minutes without firing. Some fire several times per second. Very wide timing distribution.
10183, Congrats on a great launch!
10184,But sometimes when we touch …

10190, Sure
10191,"Sure could use a good rave
What’s your favorite techno"
10192,I … I just died in your arms tonight
10193,The rumor that Bill Gates &amp; I are lovers is completely untrue
10194, Yeah. Display will also soon render Teslas specifically as their model &amp; color instead of as a generic sedan/SUV. Has potential for a fun punch buggy sort of game.
10196," We’ve been working on this for about 4 years. Originally meant for rabies vaccine, but it can make pretty much anything that’s an RNA sequence. Critical path is completing human trials."
10198, 🎶 Billy G is not my lover 🎶
10199, Sounds like he doesn’t realize Tesla makes the vaccine machine for CureVac
10200, Thanks for letting me know. Will dig into it.
10201, 😉
10202, Sum &gt; parts
10203," Should add a few miles of range, more in slow traffic"
10204, The government has the most money by far. They talk in trillions.
10205, Haha no one can ever have our top secret fart technology!!
10206, 💕 💕
10207, Sure
10208," Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains &amp; batteries. We’re just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!"
10209, What he doesn’t appear to appreciate is that government is just a monopolist corporation in the limit
10210, !
10211, Agreed
10212, Haha
10213, It’s a prototype of the color
10214, And to think I used to like Bernie! 😢
10215, 🕊🕊
10216, Maybe he’s feeling the bern haha
10217," Fuel spin valve didn’t open. Will fix &amp; try again tomorrow. Also, some odd TVC hydraulic pump behavior."
10218," I was just out at the launch pad. Connector damaged in the storm, but fixed now. Might be able to fire tonight or at least get to the next issue."
10219," Whether commercial or government, monopolies are bad for the people"
10220, Sounds great
10221, Haha
10222,Das Kapital in a nutshell

10229," Wow, you think about me a lot!"
10230, You dropped this
10231, 🌹
10232, Haha
10233, Giga Berlin will come together at an impossible-seeming speed. The prefabricated construction method in Germany is extremely impressive.
10234,Almost a decade ago. Original Dragon in background.
10235, Ya just can’t beat BR
10237, Planet Claire is 🔥🔥
10238, Fair point! Will discuss with team.
10239, He was amazing
10240,Great song
10241," Nickel is the biggest challenge for high-volume, long-range batteries! Australia &amp; Canada are doing pretty well. US nickel production is objectively very lame. Indonesia 🇮🇩 is great!"
10242, 🤣🤣
10243, That’s me! Haha
10244, This has a lot of potential. Lithium is pretty much everywhere.
10245, Whoa cool
10246, 🤣🤣
10247, Has to be blue steel :)
10248," We need high Brinell hardness &amp; high corrosion resistance. Because of Cybertruck’s faceted nature, formability is not important."
10249, I really want to do this! Will be great fun. Could be both LA and Austin.
10250, Turning them into shade for an outdoor restaurant here in Boca
10251, Cool
10252, Yes
10253, Not impossible
10254, Those were the days! 🤣🤣
10255, Ring of Fire
10256, I know! Congratulations to the people of Bolivia 🇧🇴!!
10257, The song I whistle most is Strangers in the Night
10258, Some of whom seriously think Tesla toppled the Bolivian govt (sigh)
10259, Great song
10260, Haha thanks Kara :)
10261, For sure
10262," Yeah, we’re hunkering down here until the hurricane passes"
10263, Exactly!
10264,Cool Model 3 review by
10265, Tesla will add a power lift gate at no cost
10266," Agreed, hydrogen fool sells make no sense"
10267,Pronouns suck
10268," Also, we get our lithium from Australia"
10269, 🤣🤣
10270," Yeah, would have been way better just to send everyone $6k"
10271,I bet no one on 🌹 Twitter even *has* a guillotine! Poseurs …
10272, [slow drag on cigarette) Facebook? Haven’t heard that name in years …
10273,🌹 Twitter sucks
10274," Something like that. If politicians could legislate wealth, everyone would be a trillionaire."
10275,"These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all, it should just be direct payments to consumers."
10276, Pretty much
10277,"Goal of government should be to maximize the happiness of the people. Giving each person money allows them to decide what meets their needs, rather than the blunt tool of legislation, which creates self-serving special interests."
10278,"As a reminder, I’m in *favor* of universal basic income"
10279,Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people imo
10280,Tesla solar panels are $1.49/Watt 
10281, Thank you on behalf of the Tesla team. We look forward to building Giga Texas!
10282, Something fun is coming
10283, Could be great!
10284, That’s a great idea!
10285," We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire, if interested."
10286," Tbh, we are just a bit less foolish than before"
10287," Especially for boost stage, which is volumetrically constrained, CH4 is way better than H2. Soviet CH4 engine prototypes from 80’s were very advanced. Glad to see reusability is being factored in."
10288," Basically, our pixel size"
10289, Can’t emphasize this enough
10290, Absolutely
10291, Haha
10292, Agreed
10293, My oven keeps asking for my wifi password. It’s not gonna get it.
10294,Impressive Tianwen-1 Mars rover mission launched by China today
10295, Good article
10296, Similar problem with US data
10297, Good point

10309, This one stings
10310,Where are the memes? Send in … the memes …
10311," We need to finish upgrading Autopilot to 4D vs ~2.5D, then it will go up very steep slopes"
10312,Nothing has gaslit more people than the movie Gaslight
10313," Well said, Brian Williams!"
10314, Great shot!
10315, 👍
10316," Sometimes, that’s how I feel too!"
10317, Will attempt to fly later this week
10318, Sound &amp; flame color will be quite different
10319, Yes
10320," We’re rapidly changing alloy constituents &amp; forming methods, so traditional names like 304L will become more of an approximation"
10321, 🤣🤣
10322," At some point, we should probably do advertising as art/communication/entertainment &amp; to support high quality media"
10323,Das baby kann noch keinen löffel benutzen
10324, It’s almost right
10325, We talked about an hour ago. He seems fine.
10326, VR Twitter with avatars saying the mentions 😈
10327, We should bring Life to Mars
10328,Both fairing halves caught from space by ships!
10329," Nice work, SpaceX team!"
10330, Still long way to go. Reuse only matters to degree that it’s rapid &amp; complete.
10331, Too long since we were last there
10332,Launch in 20 mins
10333, Lithium is extremely common on Earth. Found almost everywhere.
10334, Congratulations MHI &amp; UAE!
10335, Stilton
10336, New deep crimson from Giga Berlin is my favorite
10337, Important to service very high latitudes
10338," American, but born in South Africa. Left by myself when I was 17."
10339," True, the 2012 Model S is still a great car. Was driving SN28 a few months ago and driving feel was excellent. Model S remains my fav car to drive."
10340, Will discuss on Wed earnings call. Lots to talk about!
10341, 🤣🤣
10342, Yes
10343, This looks cool
10344, It has that potential
10345," Good article. I started The Boring Company as a joke, but now it’s digging real tunnels!"
10346," It’s not really set up for tours, but maybe it should"
10347, Manufactured only 5 mins from LAX!
10348," Some contribute more. Y chromosome &amp; mitochondria are constant, except for mutations."
10349, Yes
10350," That is just one part of the surgery. For this to scale, it must be fully automated, like LASIK."
10351,This would solve a lot of brain/spine injuries &amp; is ultimately essential for AI symbiosis
10352, Fermi was awesome. He understood the right questions to ask.
10353, 🤣🤣
10354, BDE
10355, How come Hulk never loses pants!?
10356, Yes

10361,It’s inevitable
10362," Excuse me, I only sell Doge!"
10363,Will those who write the algorithms ever realize their negativity bias?
10364, Pretty much
10365, We better hustle with Neuralink. Not moving fast enough.
10366,Thanks
10367,Just stop
10368, 💕💕
10369, 🤣🤣
10370, Gigafactory is the product even more than the car
10371, Yes
10372, Carefully hidden
10373, Sure
10374, Might be an indoor/outdoor rave space on the roof
10375,Giga Berlin
10376," Exactly, this is a serious problem. Ratio of retirees to workers is tracking towards unsustainability in many countries. An upside down demographic pyramid is unstable."
10377, Considering
10378, Small note: latch on post near base is gone &amp; powered Ethernet wire is less obtrusive in production version
10380," This thing we call “money” is just a (slow, lossy &amp; unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor &amp; necessitate UBI."
10381, Trying to set a good example haha. Mars needs people!
10382, Great work by Tesla software engineering
10383, Population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after AI imo
10384," Yeah, will take less than a minute to order on when it goes live"
10385," Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in &amp; give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden, on roof, table, pretty much anywhere, so long as it has a wide view of the sky."
10386, Ok
10387, 🤔
10388," To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale don’t lie."
10389, Exactly
10390," Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also, what about Autobahn!?"
10391," The strength &amp; perseverance of the people of Tesla, despite facing extreme difficulties"
10392, Playable on any Tesla!
10393, Should do this automatically
10394, Cute
10395, Wow
10396, Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire 3 times per flight.
10397, Wild times!
10398, We’re being extra paranoid. Maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount.
10399, Welcome anytime
10400," Well, I do care very much about sustainability of civilization, but there is some truth to the irony part haha"
10401," Yes, in plan. Superchargers and public high power wall connectors will keep growing exponentially every year."
10402, 👀
10403, I think so
10404," Doing range testing now. Number will be significantly higher than 300. Extremely good for any EV, especially an SUV."
10405," We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor &amp; will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent"
10406, It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge
10407," No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)"
10408," We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically, won’t be quite 1000 mph charging, as X especially is much bigger than 3."
10409, Hell of a ride!
10410, Thanks :)
10411, That is the near-term danger of AI
10412, I didn’t mind DA2. DA1 was awesome. Mass Effect 2 (talking about sequels) is amazing.
10413, Haha
10414, Maybe he should design flag of Mars

10419, SPQR
10420, True haha
10421, Death is the loss of information
10422, Earning power post augmentation would easily pay for itself (if that’s even necessary). This is the best thing I can think of to ensure that collective human will decides the future.
10423, Absolutely
10424, 👀
10425, Probably a good one to design &amp; engineer in Germany
10426, Even more
10427, Ok
10428, 👀
10429, Berlin Model Y is the one to watch. That is a revolution in automotive body engineering (finally).
10430,"Wow, IHOP &amp; GitHub are close"
10431,Best use of the term “Full Stack”?
10432, For sure. This is both great &amp; terrifying. Everything we’ve ever sensed or thought has been electrical signals. The early universe was just a soup of quarks &amp; leptons. How did a very small piece of the Universe start to think of itself as sentient?
10433, Yes
10434," Sorry, should hopefully be soon!"
10435," Not actually a payout, just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out, as the stock can’t be sold for 5 years after exercise. The stock must be bought &amp; income taxes paid, then hold value for 5 years."
10436," No easy way to answer this in a tweet, but helping with dire brain injuries is our first priority. Details Aug 28."
10437,AI symbiosis while u wait
10438, There’s some of that too
10439," True, it sounds so surreal, but the negative propaganda is still all out there &amp; easy to find in social media &amp; press interviews, so it’s not just our imagination!"
10440, Make sure to read ur terms &amp; conditions before clicking accept!

10450," Essentially. Long-term purpose of my Tesla stock is to help make life multiplanetary to ensure it’s continuance. The massive capital needs are in 10 to 20 years. By then, if we’re fortunate, Tesla’s goal of accelerating sustainable energy &amp; autonomy will be mostly accomplished."
10451, Thank goodness for modern medicine!
10452, For sure
10453," Coming soon, our battle with Big Tequila! It’s real."
10454, That would be next-level 🤣🤣
10455, I bought a pair of XL

10472," Yeah, it’s pretty weird"
10473," Yeah, but first we need to finish Giga Berlin and a second US Giga to serve eastern half of North America"
10474, Nice haha
10475, It may have started already

10482, Sorry to hear about this. Hope you get back to orbit soon. Rockets are hard.
10484, You have my full support!
10485, 🤣🤣
10486,Please take a moment to report accounts clearly engaged in harassment. It is the only way to maintain public discourse.
10487,🇺🇸🇺🇸 Happy 4th of July!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸
10488, That would be great
10489," Agreed, but it’s hard to ignore what is effectively a social media denial of service attack"
10490," Accounts that unequivocally advocate harassment should be suspended with warning, then shut down if repeated"
10491, True
10492," Yeah, but why? I’m working on sustainable energy cars &amp; solar that help Earth and making life multiplanetary, to ensure its continuance, with SpaceX."
10493," Thanks, that would promote good public discourse"
10494, A pseudojourno asked all his followers to spam my mentions
10495, Wow
10496, True
10497, You’re a good person
10498," To the best our knowledge, he never toured SpaceX. Don’t know where that comes from."
10499, I was at that Vanity Fair party with. Don’t know Ghislaine. Real question is why did VF invite her?
10500," Now you’re unblocked, so stop whining"
10501, I only block people as a direct insult
10502," Yes. Green card (permanent residency) is fine too for SpaceX, according to ITAR rules."
10503," Yeah, Tesla app would enable you to release your car into the fleet &amp; summon it back at will"
10504," Directly, my companies employ roughly 65,000 people. However, there is a massive global supply &amp; logistics chain that employs 4 to 5 times that number."
10505," RWD is slightly more efficient, but dual motor AWD is faster &amp; more agile"

10512, Thanks for hosting me in Tulsa today!
10513," This is false. I landed in Montreal at age 17 with $2000, a backpack of clothes &amp; suitcase of books. My father is bankrupt &amp; has been for a long time. I inherited literally nothing from him."
10514, She photobombed me at a Vanity Fair Oscar party. Was there with. Don’t know Ghislaine at all. Why do you think it should be a bigger story?
10515," Greenspan is crackers, bananas, barky &amp; ten cards short of a full deck"
10516," Others will probably pass human trials first, but this machine is pretty special for generalized vaccine production. Was originally intended for rabies, which is a very tricky virus."
10517, Interesting
10518," Good point, we don’t"
10519, Coming soon
10520, HCL appears to be effective when used early
10521," Unfortunately, there are thousands of automotive design rule differences between US &amp; EU, including completely different charge ports. Gets worse every year. Not our choice."
10522, There’s that too. Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of.
10523, Deaths continue to trend down
10524," We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives."
10525, Yes
10526," The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative."
10527, Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll. Big mistake. Never go full troll!
10528," Oh yeah, Klip Einstein, pseudojournalist &amp; douche-about-town"
10529, 😂😂
10530, Someone is paying for hundreds of bots &amp; trolls to push this lame Vanity Fair photobomb pic. I wonder who …
10531, 🤣🤣 true
10532, This is false. I have never introduced either of them to anyone.
10533, Sounds sketch
10534, Pretty much
10535, Haute couture
10536, Thanks!
10537, Don’t know Ghislaine at all. She photobombed me once at a Vanity Fair party several years ago. Real question is why VF invited her in the first place 🤔
10538," Thanks Viv, you rock 💕"
10539, Ok fine 🤣🤣
10540, Exactly
10541, Yes
10542,Thanks Tesla owners &amp; investors! Love you!! We will work super hard to earn your trust &amp; support.
10543, Thank goodness! Front license plates make my eyes bleed.
10544, Not bad
10545, But sooo satisfying
10546,"SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon’s"
10547,Will send some to the Shortseller Enrichment Commission to comfort them through these difficult times
10548, Should have a free trade agreement with US. No tariffs at all either way.
10549, I worried we won’t be taken seriously if our short shorts have flames 🤣🤣
10550, He wore them well. No denying it.
10551, Busted! I secretly ♥️ short shorts.
10552,Tesla will make fabulous short shorts in radiant red satin with gold trim
10553, Great interview 🤣🤣
10554, Yes
10555, Those dang budgie smugglers!!
10556,Who wears short shorts? 🤣🤣
10557, Awesome!!
10558, Thank you. Angie …
10559, bs
10560," You cherry-picked one state out of fifty, which saw a minor uptick. Show the whole country."
10561, I tried to warn them … 😢
10562, Yup
10563," Something’s messed up about medicine that’s anti-science. In science, you question everyone, no matter who they are. Facts &amp; reasoning are everything, but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials, often by people who’ve accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one."
10564, Here’s one:
10565," Yes, Angela, please show us the graphs/data that prove your point"
10566," I’m not building anything on ethereum. Not for or against it, just don’t use it or own any."
10567, Lithium is common. Hard part is turning lithium salt or clay into extremely pure LiOH.
10568," Yes, at Tesla Grohmann"
10569," Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac &amp; possibly others"
10570," In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem."
10571," As you’d expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy."
10572, Seems fishy
10573, 🤣🤣 very true
10574," A lot of functionality will happen all at once when we transition to the new software stack. Most likely, it will be releasable in 2 to 4 months. Then it’s a question of what functionality is proven safe enough to enable for owners."
10575," Going well. Team is kicking ass &amp; it’s an honor to work with them. Pretty much everything had to be rewritten, including our labeling software, so that it’s fundamentally “3D” at every step from training through inference."
10576, Crassus was a dick
10577, Haha awesome 🤣🤣
10578, Hell of a decade
10579, I love Texas! Starship production complex is in Boca Chica &amp; SpaceX engine development has been in McGregor for almost 18 years.
10580, Aiming for 10km with lots of turns to better approximate a real-world tunnel
10581," You just have to be a shareholder. There is limited space, so sign up fast when we do final confirmation of date &amp; location."
10582," Wow, I’ve never seen this level of support! Out of respect, seems like I should at least visit."
10583, We need to finish building a much longer vacuum tunnel for speed tests &amp; probably have an additional competition for tunneling itself
10584," All questions will be answered on Battery Day, Sept 15th. Will be webcast, although there is much to see in person."
10585,"Tesla Impact Report (repost). We do everything humanly possible to source materials &amp; produce sustainable energy cars, batteries &amp; solar ethically. Suggestions for improvement are always appreciated.
"
10586," Things often don’t translate from mice to humans, but that’s promising"
10587, Likely true
10588, Yes
10589, Starlink will provide global coverage
10590, Worth discussing at annual shareholders meeting
10591, Party on …
10592, Fixing
10593," Extremely big difference between died because of or died with. Also, did the person actually have C19 or did they just have C19 symptoms? It’s almost impossible to die without feeling weakness, shortness of breath or other C19 symptoms, unless you were crushed by a falling piano."
10594,Your GPS just got slightly better
10595, This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
10596," If accurate, this would explain a lot"
10597, Levitt is right
10598," There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none."
10599, Very much agree
10600, Good hygiene always makes sense
10601, True
10602, Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
10604," There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest."
10605,"Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla."
10606,Great Model Y review by
10607, Dogs rock
10608,69 days after 4/20 again haha
10609," Physics favors electric transport, batteries for stationary storage &amp; solar/wind for energy generation"
10610, Major Supercharger increases are underway for the greater LA area
10611, For sure
10612," Verified should be far more widespread, simply that someone is who they claim to be"
10613, It’s a tough one. That’s why we should expand the scope &amp; scale of consciousness — to understand the nature of the Universe.
10614, Jay is awesome
10615, Absolutely!
10616, Giga Berlin is gonna rock!
10617,.@JeffBezos is a copy 🐈 haha
10618, It’s close though 😅
10619," This makes no sense for many other reasons too. They don’t actually have spectrum priority, they have shared spectrum &amp; nothing about this company is UK, except post office box. Money would be better spent on actual UK satellite industry!"
10620, Glad you like it!
10621, Great idea
10622,"Who controls the memes,
controls the Universe"
10624, 🤣🤣
10625,Literally
10626,Only a matter of time before someone steals a Tesla while playing GTA on a Tesla
10627," Very meta, but yes"
10628, True
10629, Coming soon
10630,North American Supercharger usage tracking to exceed pre covid highs in 2 to 3 weeks. Lot of noise out there. This is signal.
10631, I think we could make that work
10632, Glad you’re ok
10633," Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality &amp; market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert &gt;80% of the global road, sea &amp; air fleet to renewables by 2050."
10634, Looks pretty cool
10635, Could be slightly faster
10636,Two Starship tanks in the midbay
10637, Ok
10638,Special thanks to Tesla trucking &amp; rail partners for figuratively &amp; literally going the extra mile
10639,Apologies to Tesla customers for shifting delivery dates. It’s a crazy world out there!
10640," Yes, it is designed to serve the least-served"
10641," Yes, although Starlink works best for low population density situations"
10642, Canada is a major priority for Starlink!
10643, September sounds about right
10644, Well said by
10645," Takes longer to get regulatory approvals in Europe, plus way more diverse traffic signs, lights &amp; road rules"
10646," Timing is uncertain, given externalities, but yes"
10647, Congratulations!
10648," Very much disagree with this action. In my experience, these skillsets are net job creators. Visa reform makes sense, but this is too broad."
10649, Will be changed to $3k until July 1st
10650, Yes
10651, Yes
10652,Tentative date for Tesla Shareholder Meeting &amp; Battery Day is Sept 15. Will include tour of cell production system.
10653, Done. Now $2k via in-app purchase.
10654,Reminder that Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) price goes up by $1k on July 1st
10655,Enabling basic Tesla Autopilot via Tesla in-app purchase is reduced to $2k until July 1
10656, All patched up!
10657," Entirely possible. Social media is a limbic amplifier, which inherently destabilizes civilization."
10658, Ensure future of Earth &amp; extend life sustainably to other planets
10659, Probably early Q4
10660,2019 seems so quaint &amp; long ago
10661, There are no signs of intelligent life

10671,"If heat death is the end of the universe, it really is all about the journey"
10672, Best definition of innovation I’ve ever heard
10673, All good
10674, Will follow up by tomorrow
10675, Sure
10676," Will do. I play PC, so missed some of console exclusives."
10677, Haha sure
10678, Deus Ex / Half-Life 2 / Bioshock / Mass Effect 2 / Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas / Saints Row IV
10679," There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD"
10680," This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?"
10681, This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
10682," Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure."
10683, Haha Teslas all the way down
10684," Maybe, will look into it. We’d need to emulate a TV."
10685," We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game, with extra points for rare Teslas"
10686, Bought based on your review. It’s great!
10687," The was not to outcompete other companies, but rather to maximize usefulness &amp; rate of progress in the absolute"
10688," For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do"
10689," Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies"
10690, We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering &amp; great feedback from Tesla owners in China!
10691," Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app &amp; overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet"
10692, Feels so long ago
10693, Pulling up to The Petersen
10694, Nice
10695, We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter
10696, It will look a little odd
10697, Probably Fremont
10698," Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. I’m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week."
10699," Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later."
10700, Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.
10701," It does require use of a paid-time-off day, which is true of many other holidays"
10702,Juneteenth is henceforth considered a US holiday at Tesla &amp; SpaceX
10703, Moving fast
10704, Opening in about two weeks
10705, Confirmed
10707, 🤣🤣
10708, We are considering several options
10709," Tesla has an option to purchase this land, but has not exercised it"
10710, Renewable energy is happening fast
10711, Comes standard with Cybertruck
10712, Not sure. They’re pretty close together.
10713, It will be real
10714, Maybe Incat
10715, There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
10716, We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch &amp; landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
10717," Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system &amp; doesn’t come back &amp; land"
10718," US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology"
10719, Pretty much
10720, Illuminaughty haha
10721, Maybe some Flextape
10722," No problem, we can buff it out"
10723, Fairing reuse is looking good
10724, So where are the aliens?
10725, Or Y
10726, No larger pack Model 3 is in development
10727," Actually, we’ve made slight changes, but the range improvement is &gt;90% efficiency"
10728, Cool
10729, Physics doesn’t care about politicians
10730, Coming soon
10731,All Model S cars made since late Jan have 402 mile range. This is just making it official.
10732,Tesla Model S now first ever electric vehicle to receive EPA range rating above 400 miles!
10733, Absolutely
10734,China &amp; Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.
10735, Looking likely
10736," Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out."
10737," Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
10738," Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed."
10739, Yes
10740," That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points."
10741, Accurate
10742, Sure
10743," Around 20ms. It’s designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency."
10744, It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in &amp; point at sky. Can be done in either order.
10745, Congratulations Kathy!
10746," Acceptable, if your drivetrain is very efficient &amp; you add a little manga"
10747, As foretold by
10748, Stonks
10749,lol
10750," Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once."
10751, True
10752," Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great."
10753, I thought this was an Onion article
10754, Staggeringly dumb
10755, I got the fuel cell question about 8000 times
10756, It’s getting Biblical
10757," Exactly, fuel cells = fool sells"
10758, Renewable energy passed coal in April
10759, Worth considering
10760, Agreed
10761, Trèy Boucher
10762, Great point. Many articles are retweeted based on headlines that don’t match the content.
10763," Actually, we’re on SN30 for Raptor"
10764, Sure. That’s long montage 🤣🤣
10765, Wow
10766, ❤️ the laser beam long exposure shots
10767," Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it’s 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration …"
10768," Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell."
10769,Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast
10770," Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2."
10771,After which they are recycled
10772,Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km
10773,"Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories"
10774,"Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount"
10776,"Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets"
10777, Haha. Will post summary.
10778," Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage"
10779," Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80’s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs."
10780,Wort reading the whole thing
10781, We shall see …
10782, Maybe I should retweet the top four or five point. What caught your eye the most?
10783, Good point!
10784, Yes
10785, (Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative &amp; political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad &amp; angry. That’s why they’re being crushed by. Likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. Ironic article:
10786, Size matters
10787, Sure seems that way 🤣🤣
10788, Bad incentive structure
10789, We’re working on new legs. Wider stance &amp; able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky &amp; pitted surfaces.
10790," Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha."
10791, Absolutely
10792," Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible."
10793, 🤣
10794," Autopilot prime directive is: don’t crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision &amp; sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential."
10795,Stankonia at
10796, Good point
10797, And those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke
10798, 81m
10799, Yeah. Even stacking on the pad will be quite an adventure!
10800, Creating the production system is &gt;1000% harder than building one rocket. This is the truly hard thing.
10801, It’s insane
10802, Pursuing all three. Hard to say right now.
10803,Gateway to Mars
10804, Lot has happened since then!

10821, Methalox is the right propellant. Should be staged combustion &amp; highly reusable.
10822, Yes
10823," About a dozen transfer windows, so ~25 years"
10824," Wow, hard to believe that was 10 years ago!"
10825, Jack is doing his best. I support him.
10826, Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!
10827, This is insane
10828, That’s when all life on Earth will be boiled off. What matters is how long civilization is capable of making the jump to Mars. This could be a very short period of time measured in decades. It took 4.5 billion years to get to this point &amp; civilization isn’t looking super stable.
10829," So many war stories over 18 eventful years! But Starship can make life multiplanetary, which is what really matters for safeguarding the light of consciousness &amp; life as we know it. 100X improvement over Falcon/Dragon."
10830,Off Twitter for a while
10831, Starship is the key to making life multiplanetary &amp; protecting the light of consciousness
10832, Well said
10833, Definitely not right that the other officers were charged with nothing. What message does this send in general to officers who stand by while another does wrong? #JusticeForGeorge
10834, Where’s the banana!?

10871," His ideas sound sensible, but he was not my or SpaceX’s “brain coach”. I think he maybe gave a talk once."
10872, 5 years ago. We need to accelerate progress towards fully reusable rockets. Cost per ton to orbit needs to improve by &gt;1000% from where Falcon is today for there to be a self-sustaining city on Mars.
10873, Mars needs to happen soon
10874,Made on Earth by humans
10876, Cool
10877, Pretty much
10878," Reviewed design with Franz last night. Even 3% smaller is too small. Will be pretty much this size. We’ll probably do a smaller, tight world truck at some point."

10927, Totally. Collective mind control by stoking fear.
10928," Yes, improvement is exponential"
10929, Yeah. Maybe following individual journalists &amp; citizen journalists is better than publications. The Onion may be the best mainstream media source. Hard to figure out what’s actually going on in the world!
10930,It’s remarkable how often The News attempts to answer the question: what is the worst thing that happened on Earth today?

10951, Exactly
10952, Tesla makes the safest cars in the world &amp; our factory injury rate is better than industry avg &amp; tracking to be better than any auto plant in North America. We care deeply about safety at a fundamental level.
10953," SpaceX has 8000 employees in California, Washington, Texas &amp; Florida. Operating this entire time, as we have national security exemption. Zero deaths or serious illnesses."
10954, Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with 7000 employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses.
10955," The statistics stopped being valid when anyone with “covid symptoms”, which is now almost anything, was counted as having covid"
10956," Well said! Please run for office. The politicians &amp; unelected bureaucrats who stole our liberty should be tarred, feathered &amp; thrown out of town!"

10995,"Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me."
10996," Yes, California approved, but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also, all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up!"

11029, Absolutely
11030, Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with
11031," Yes, already done"
11032, Yes
11033, Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California &amp; second biggest exporter
11034, Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
11035," Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county."
11036," San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada."
11037," Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."
11038," Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!"
11039," No, I have a license!"

11042, Turns out hobbits are enormous

11044, Glad we could help
11045, It’s true
11046, Coming soon
11047," Yes, this is a high priority"
11048," Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%"
11049," Pain can certainly be turned off, but we’re not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet"
11050, Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
11051, That’s harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
11052, Ok
11053, !
11054," It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal."
11055," To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs."
11056," Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)"
11057, Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
11058," Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg."
11059, 🤣🤣
11060, A mandatory tracing app would be insane
11061, True
11062, Probably makes sense to have a “Details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
11063, Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes 🤣🤣
11064, Would cover latitude of London
11065, Yes
11066," Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms."
11067," It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator"
11068, Sure :)
11069, Way more important than it sounds
11070, Yeah!!
11071," A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."
11072, SLS makes me feel sad
11073," No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded"
11074," Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine"
11075, A great mystery of the universe
11076, It’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
11077," Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!"
11078," Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life."
11079," In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid"
11080," Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars!"
11081," Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we’ll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack."
11082, Turns on city street intersections is the big one
11083, Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
11084, Not SpaceX
11085, His son sounds great btw
11086, 2008 was a super tough year on all levels
11087," Tesla &amp; SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That’s why."
11088, Good for them! About half the US will be mostly open by this weekend.
11089, Yes

11105," Happy, healthy &amp; cute as a button :)"
11106, This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?
11107, There would be time-stamped video if this were true
11108, Should be a lot of fun!
11109, There are many pieces to the puzzle
11110, DKE in a nutshell: we’re almost always dumber than we think we are
11111, That would be awesome
11112," This is false. JD’s team put out “video evidence”, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated."
11113," Yeah, definitely a future feature"
11114, Levitt rocks
11115," Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also, distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms."
11116, Utter moron
11117, Thanks! Something more should be done. This guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake “science”.
11118, What a tool
11119, Nope. Thanks!

11126," Anyway, we’re just talking about 2% here, so not much. Confident Model S will get 400+ miles as soon as retest is allowed."
11127, Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
11128, I hope anything lands
11129, It seems unlikely right now
11130, Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.
11131, Thanks!
11132, Commentary is quite entertaining! MST3K
11133,SN4 🔥 soon. Raptor looks so smōl.
11134, Good chance it accelerates viral vaccines &amp; cures

11144,"Well said, Lord Sumption, well said!"
11145," Ok, we will"
11146," Yes, about a month away from testing Raptor Vacuum"
11147," A little. Will have 31 engines, not 37, no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton, but upgrades in the works for 250 ton."
11148,Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
11149,Minecraft has amazing legs
11150,That was 2.5 years ago &amp; still not even on the moon. Progress must accelerate!

11190, You got it!
11191, Exactly
11192, Well said

11194, AI makes more progress
11195,This is misleading to the public

11224, Interesting
11225, Yes
11226, Just one. SN5 will get three.
11227, Static fire with Raptor hopefully later this week
11228," 4.9 bar. Kind of a softball tbh, but that’s enough to fly!"
11229, Great work by SpaceX engineering!
11230,SN4 passed cryo proof! 😅
11231, What do you make of the FT claims?
11232," FT is saying current death rate is extremely unusual, but you’re saying 2017 was higher. Which is correct?"
11233,Snowing in Texas
11234,Cryo test underway
11235, How is it considered probable if there’s no covid test? Is just a cough or high temperature enough?
11236, So dark out there
11237, Would be helpful to distinguish deaths caused by covid vs unrelated to covid!
11238, True
11239, .@officialmcafee may be 🥜 but his tweets are 🔥🔥
11240,Interesting …
11241, Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
11242,Docs make good points 
11243," Yes, switching soon to a 300 series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. 301 is good as sheet, but not as plate. Also, a lot of geometric changes."
11244, Successive iteration of both design &amp; manufacturing. Latter is 1000% harder than former.
11245, It’s a little dicey tbh. Thrust dome is being redesigned. Current one has four separate layers of steel in some places!
11246, 150m
11247, Physically ready in a few weeks. Approvals may take longer.
11248,Aiming for cryo pressure test tonight

11254, Heard same from doc I trust
11255," No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad"
11256, That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
11257,So often true 🤣🤣
11258, Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
11259, Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated.
11260," As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it"
11261, It’s also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard
11262, Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
11263, Progress is good
11264, Definitely
11265, Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation.
11266," Sure, we can probably do an update later this year"
11267, Needs to be more than halfway to east coast
11268," Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity"
11269, Yes
11270, Yes

11280, Hard to imagine 2030
11281, Seems so long ago
11282, Exactly
11283,Welcome to the Tesla board! Honored to have you.
11284, 👍
11285, 🤣🤣
11286,Starship SN4 tank on test stand
11287," Yes, same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities &amp; mortality proportionate to age."
11288,Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted &amp; herd immunity much higher. Good news.
11289, Maybe Cybertruck will have it …
11290," I’m dying to do super efficient, quiet home HVAC with HEPA &amp; water distillation. It’s weird, but I really want to do it."
11291, Good one
11292, Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
11293," Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing."
11294," That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil &amp; gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy."
11295, So shall we all
11296, Yes
11297, Haha sure
11298, Good summary
11299, Coming soon
11300, Yes
11301, Yes
11302," Yeah, it’s named after my friend Joe who suggested the feature"
11303, Maybe just make Joe Mode quieter?
11304," Private beta begins in ~3 months, public beta in ~6 months, starting with high latitudes"
11305,"In advance of this, please try to hack Starlink &amp; Tesla Mothership!"
11306,There are now 420 operational Starlink satellites 🛰 😉
11307, New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan
11308," Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too, but nothing’s as weird as reality!"
11309," It’s made of a special dark foam that’s extremely radio transparent, so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor."
11310, Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. We’re fixing it now.
11311, Yes
11312, Small amount of isopropyl alcohol (cleaning fluid) was trapped in a sensor dead leg &amp; ignited in flight
11313, Sure hope so!
11314," Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so"
11315, Not the greatest use of money
11316," If this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites …"
11317, Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
11318, Makes sense
11319, Nice
11320, Anything surprising?
11321, Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
11322, No kidding …
11323, Good article
11324," Am in Boca working on the rocket with an awesome team, so pretty great :)"
11325, 🤣🤣
11326," Definitely header tanks &amp; nosecone on SN5, hopefully flaps too. Definitely flaps on SN6"
11327, Crazy times!
11328," Red sky of Mars is
Blue at dawn &amp; dusk"
11329, Check the warranty …
11330, Thanks everyone! Still can’t believe I was born 69 days after 4/20 🤓
11331, Yes. It will even float for a while.
11332," Yeah, and whole lot more! Aargh, I’m dying to make Cybertruck like yesterday!!"
11333, Thinking about this …
11334, This is the key paragraph
11335, Pretty much
11336, Mechanically attached to steel studs. Insulation is certainly the intention!
11337,Best political platform ever
11338," SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing &amp; now docking with, which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves &amp; will be uncrewed at first."
11339, Great platform 🤣🤣
11340, !!
11341," Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars"
11342, 10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
11343," I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind."
11344," Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter."
11345, Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
11346, Probably 3 to 6 months
11347," Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points"
11348, You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.
11349, My kids loved that one when they were little
11350, 🤣🤣
11351, Congratulations again! Starfleet begins …
11352, The way it should be!
11353, You’re welcome! Very exciting times ahead for space.
11354," Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel."
11355," No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose."
11356, SN5
11357," No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry"
11358, 🤣🤣
11359," Similar, but seemingly small changes can have surprisingly big effects"
11360, Should be available as an in app purchase next month
11361," You’re right, will fix"
11362," Good point. Yeah, Remdesivir is sounding very promising!"
11363,Orbital human spaceflight returns to the Cape in six weeks!
11364, Advertising salespeople dressed as truth tellers
11365, #CancelNewsNetwork
11366," Trying have fewer parts, so strakes are unlikely. Some very counterintuitive CFD results in both hypersonic &amp; subsonic regimes. Starship does controlled falling more than flying."
11367," Flaps, actuator &amp; static aero are undergoing redesign for mass reduction &amp; simplicity"
11368, Will do
11369, True
11370, Exactly
11371,"Good progress, but 18 years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime."
11372," Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up &amp; operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system."
11373," It’s a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but it’s the future we should have"
11374, Reviewing overall system with vehicle engineering team next week. Should have number then.
11375," Reduced size by ~3%, center line is more level &amp; lower window sill height"
11376, 🤣🤣
11377, All new
11378," It is about 10% too small, but lots of fun 😀"
11379, We’re working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.
11380, Karma is real
11381," Yeah, super messed up"
11382,"These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment"
11383,Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators
11384, Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function? The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.
11385, Nice
11386, All
11387, Interesting
11388, So true
11389," Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help!"
11390, I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 🤣🤣
11396, .@GavinNewsom please fix this misunderstanding
11397, Exactly
11398, What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
11399,“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
11400,“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
11401," A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
11402, Sounds about right
11403, Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
11404," I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
11405, We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
11406," They were, but are they currently?"
11407, Interesting
11408," We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty."
11409, Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
11410, Sure
11411," Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …"
11412," SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps."
11413, That’s for sure! 😅
11414, I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀
11415, My (again) personal favorite is
11416," Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle."
11417," Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2."
11418, SN26
11419," Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!"
11420," The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!"
11421," Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch"
11422," Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US."
11423," Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage."
11424," Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%."
11425," Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!"
11426," Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
11427," Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
11428," Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test."
11429,"To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop"
11430,Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
11431, You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
11432," There’s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!"
11433,"Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature"
11434, This will happen
11435, We stole that from cheetahs
11436," In case it’s not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs"
11437," There’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&amp;A."
11438," Just battery day, but it will be great. Plaid powertrain will be later this year."
11439, 五輪書
11440,"While others party, he study the blade"
11441, DayQuil or NyQuil?
11442,"Happy Easter!
Follow the 🐇"
11443, Yes
11444, Functionality still looking good for this year. Regulatory approval is the big unknown.
11445," It’s not turned on. Meant for vandalism monitoring in a robotaxi future. Also, the car has transparent windows, so spying has limited value."
11446,Turns out that gun is for the toilet paper
11447, Correct
11448," Yes, this is a real problem. The science is not in doubt."
11449, Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize
11450," In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable."
11451, The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea:
11452," Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible."
11453, A lot has happened in 8 years
11454, Good talking to you too. It was an honor.
11455," SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable, theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem."
11456, 💯 Tragedy
11457," Tunnels aren’t required for this, but might be the only realistic way to solve for downtown to downtown travel"
11458, 🤣🤣
11459,But actually
11460," The Standard Model is amazing for useful predictions. Truly amazing. Dark * seems sketch, but doesn’t appear to matter to our immediate future."
11461, … is bs
11462, String theory
11463, There’s a bit more to it than that
11464, You’re welcome!
11465, 😮
11466, All input is error. When is the fan speed wrong?
11467, Plaid Cybertruck is what I will drive
11468, I’m not sure whether that number is lucky or unlucky
11469, Hard to predict dates right now. Most likely postponed to mid May.
11470, In about a year. Would come from Giga Berlin.
11471, You may return the vehicle for a full refund in the unlikely event that it causes domestic discord
11472, Essentially
11473, .@GreatDismal
11474, Good one
11475,What is simple in one arena is often profound in another
11476, Ok
11477,Great differences in technology exist in the world about which even hardcore technologists are unaware
11478, AddLabel -&gt; PersonDressedAsCone
11479, Certainly no problem for a 144 trillion operations per second computer to make ~15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. That’s a trillion calculations between each output command.
11480," Humans drive using 2 cameras on a slow gimbal &amp; are often distracted. A Tesla with 8 cameras, radar, sonar &amp; always being alert can definitely be superhuman."
11481, Cool
11482, Aim for zero velocity just above surface &amp; fall. You won’t fall fast.
11483, Fine by me
11484,The 20th &amp; final Dragon 1 mission is complete
11485, Ok
11486, Coming soon
11487, Definitely
11488," Probably best to keep control local, but easy to check status from afar"
11489,Here you go
11490, !!
11491, 🤣🤣
11492, Puts our basic instincts on a roller coaster
11493, Twitter causes id sinuation
11494, That’s our goal!
11495, This is awesome!
11496,Starship fuel header tank
11497, Like tears in rain
11498, Ok
11499, Amazing 🤣🤣
11500,Music is a limbic resonator
11501, Nice ink
11502," Not a question of wanting to do it or not, but rather having anyone there to make sure it gets delivered &amp; works"
11503, Not true
11504, Cool!
11505, Love that Gen Shinseki quote!
11506, Nice color
11507, Lovable dog ❤️. Mine looks like yours but in black &amp; white.
11508, 🤣🤣
11509, True. Each of these engines is also slightly different. Raptor is evolving rapidly.
11510," It is stable on the ground without propellant loaded, which is an improvement from OG Atlas"
11511, She’s neither here nor there
11512, Beatrix Potter energy!
11513, One is Havanese &amp; one came from the pound
11514," Hard to tell scale, as body diameter is 9m or ~30 ft, but it looks like it could be R2D2 size in this video"
11515,So proud
11516,Raptors
11517," Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, we’re going to reuse much of the thrust section."
11518," Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe."
11519," Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo."
11520, There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
11521," If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in"
11522,We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
11523," Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2."
11524, 👍
11525,Press any key to continue
11526, You’re welcome!
11527,u r o k
11528, Tesla is on second rev of internal ventilator design. Will post an update on this tomorrow.
11529," Yeah, about $35k with shipping &amp; taxes"
11530," Bought, but SpaceX is spooling up to manufacture proportional solenoid valves for Medtronic (confirmed as critical today with chair &amp; CEO)"
11531, First Medtronic units from Tesla getting installed in NY metro area. These are for worst case situations.
11532, !!
11533," Oh sure, good point. Will discuss with team &amp; make available to buy in Tesla app."
11534, Some progress
11535," Yeah, probably July 1st"
11536, Hoping to roll out traffic lights &amp; stops to wide US release in a few weeks &amp; probably WW release in Q3 (so many variations in each country!). Very important to make sure this is done right.
11537," Homelink is 3rd party hardware that increases cost of all cars, but only some people use it, so it’s only installed upon request. Long-term, garage openers are transitioning to WiFi-activated."
11538, Monty Python &amp; Mel Brooks are my all-time favorites
11539, Northwell seems to be very pragmatic &amp; sensible. Impressive work in difficult circumstances.
11540, And how to tell if someone’s a witch
11541, So many brilliant scenes. Anarcho-syndicalism!
11542," We will see what data review says in the morning, but this may have been a test configuration mistake"
11543, It’s true 😀
11544, Air quality has a much bigger effect on health than people realize. Credit to Larry Page for making me aware of this.
11545, Some valves leaked at cryo temp. Fixing &amp; will retest soon.
11546, 🤔
11547, High quality critical feedback from Munro &amp; Co is much appreciated!
11548, Sounds promising. Will be interesting to see results of clinical trials.
11549, For those who care about details
11550, You’re most welcome! Impressive work by Mount Sinai team.
11551," SN3 passed ambient temperature pressure test last night, now doing cryogenic"
11552, Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who’s behind it.
11553," Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low."
11554," Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight."
11555," Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical."
11556, Will call when we reach Mars
11557, Exactly
11558, Definitely need a wider span
11559, Yeah
11560," Yes, v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. Need wider span, longer stroke &amp; ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds."
11561, Interesting
11562," Y has next-level upgrades, especially body castings &amp; heat pump"
11563, Happy we could be helpful! More available if needed.
11564," Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high &amp; Isp a little low, but, over time, it will be ~150t to LEO fully reusable"
11565,"We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device &amp; shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or know."
11566," The legs extend &amp; telescope out, so are longer than they seem, but not as long as they will be for SN4+"
11567, One day we will
11568, The S-curve appears to be entering the logarithmic phase
11570, Ok
11572," Hopefully, Starship will have enough flight history to substitute for Dragon for NASA missions too"
11574,Now on launch stand
11575, Seeing friends
11576,Hello from the Inside
11577," And many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving C19"
11578, This sounds great
11579, Can you do a fast antibody test?
11580, Yes
11581,"Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you’re immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind."
11582, Buzzfeed is a mind virus
11583, Also makes for a great shelter
11584," We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them"
11585," Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed."
11586," Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they’re needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues."
11587, You’re most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
11588, 🤣🤣
11589, Exactly. Douglas Adams knew what he was talking about.
11590, Yes
11591, .@mayemusk Care to comment?
11592," Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs, we’re delivering Resmed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight."
11593, Yes
11595," Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation"
11596,SN3
11597, Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
11598, Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include “estimated illness onset date”. This is a significantly less rigorous standard.
11599, C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
11600, Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
11601, Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
11602,This meme proves it
11603,It’s ducked!
11604,.@Apple pls fix awetoekreqt
11605," True., this is  accurate. You believe in journalistic integrity, but if something isn’t done, this will continue."
11606, Have let know
11607, This is messed up
11608, Both
11609," Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water &amp; just dump it on the ground."
11610," Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly"
11611," Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!"
11612," Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you’re expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy."
11613, This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
11614," Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter"
11615, The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
11616, Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
11617, 🤣🤣
11618, Will do
11619," Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:"
11620, Exactly
11621," According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries."
11622, Engineering ftw
11623, Much appreciated
11624, Have you seen more data on HCQ &amp; Z-Pak? Hard to find.
11625, Worrisome
11626, Yup
11627, We’ll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
11628, Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
11629, Nice
11630, This is great advice
11631, Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
11632," We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part."
11633, Supply chain logistics — getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
11634, You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
11635, Panic is always dumb
11636," Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”"
11637," Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors"
11638, We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
11639,Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
11640, No problem :)
11641," Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China."
11642," Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world"
11643, Fair point :)
11644," Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too."
11645, Up to 80% false positive
11646," Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."
11647, Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”.
11648, Feels like the plot of Deus Ex
11649," A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk"
11650," Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too"
11651," That won’t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can’t stay open"
11652," Yes, we’re working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won’t be needed"
11653, Interesting thread
11654, Thanks 💖
11655, China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
11656," We’re working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter"
11657," Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important."
11659," Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky."
11660," Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April"
11661, Yes
11662,No new domestic corona cases in China
11663," Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart:"
11664," Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs"
11665, Yes
11666, True
11667," Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already."
11668, We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
11670, Some helpful data from Italy
11671," Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New “confirmed” cases, not oft-reported “presumptive positive” is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China. "
11672, 0% chance of anything close
11673, 🤣🤣
11674, How does this compare to favipiravir?
11675," Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isn’t a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won’t risk non-SpaceX satellites."
11676," Yeah, most reflights ever!"
11677," Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission."
11678, 🤣🤣
11679,Because polygon doesn’t rhyme
11680, Yeah
11681, Awe tow co wrecked
11682,Abysmal autocorrect might be the #1 reason people don’t fear AI

11685, Exactly
11686, Seems to be happening a lot
11687, Very sensible. Knows how to handle exponential functions in reality.
11688," Whether Z-pak works in this situation or not, it’s a kickass med for many maladies"
11689," If Jamis needs help, he has many friends, me among them"
11690," Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes, embed engines &amp; add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also, current legs are a bit too small."
11691,Hydroxychloroquine probably better
11692, Sounds sensible
11693,"That said, danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. If we over-allocate medical resources to corona, it will come at expense of treating other illnesses. Track graph at bottom of this page:"
11694,This paper matches what I’m hearing from a lot of smart people
11695, Yeah. Fate loves irony.
11696, What’s worse is that I even told Stanford to check me for the $^#* parasite &amp; they still couldn’t find it!
11697, Yeah
11698," I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts &amp; sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt …"
11699, Was also given a lot of doxycycline
11700, Maybe helpful
11701," Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would’ve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn’t mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing."
11702,Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19
11703, 👍
11704," Slight booster length increase to 70m, so 120m for whole system. Liftoff mass ~5000 mT."
11705,Fear is the mind-killer
11706, Congratulations Giga NY team!
11707," Some parts will use 304L, as it has higher toughness at cryo temps. Will move to internally developed alloys probably end of year."
11708, Probably. Raptor sounds different to Merlin.
11709, Lot of Raptors coming through! Now operating both horizontal &amp; vertical firing stands in McGregor.
11710, Sure
11711, Will discuss with team
11712, Yes

11754,"Congratulations Tesla team on making our 1,000,000th car!!"
11755," Market was bit high anyway, so due for a correction"
11756," Static fire &amp; short flights with SN3, longer flights with SN4, but spooling up the whole Starship/Raptor production line is really what matters"
11757, SN2 (with thrust puck) passed cryo pressure &amp; engine thrust load tests late last night
11759, He studied the blade
11760, Memes are powerful
11761, Ships with a lot of people &amp; limited medical facilities are a serious issue
11762," Yeah, that’s a great one"
11763," Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!"
11764," Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!"
11765," Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality."
11766, Yeah
11767,Accurate
11768,Envelope expanded
11769," Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason."
11770,Rocket will land in highest winds ever at Cape Canaveral tonight. This is intentional envelope expansion.

11776, We’re making progress. Improved rules are going through the EU standards committees. Hopefully better in a few months.
11777," Cool, we’re tracking to release more FSD features later this month"
11778," True. Oddly, those who complained didn’t actually order FSD. Perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery."
11779,Mad respect for the makers of things
11780," No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated."

11786, This is vital
11787,Just want say that I support as Twitter CEO. He has a good ❤️.
11788, Definitely
11790," We’re stripping SN2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure, first with water, then at cryo. Hopefully, ready to test in a few days."
11791, There’s a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load. Don’t shuck the puck!
11792,Where’s Flextape when you need it!?
11793,"It’s fine, we’ll just buff it out"
11794,So … how was your night?
11795," Yes, dramatically improved imo"
11796," We need to finish work on Autopilot core foundation code &amp; 3D labelling, then functionality will happen quickly. Not long now."
11797, 👀
11798, I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch
11799, It’s not that big really
11800, Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
11801, It’s not mine
11802, Definitely! What’s in that sky city thing!?  Needs a prequel even more than a sequel.
11803, Sure
11804, Posting SpaceX videos is definitely not copyright infringement!
11805," Hopefully, in March. Checking …"
11806, I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though!
11807," Full disclosure, I’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. It’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!"
11808," We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat &amp; strong, we’re building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement."
11809, Yes

11824,Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing
11825," Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient &amp; range, latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact"
11826, It’s slightly better
11827, Definitely worth trying imo
11828," Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
11829, Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
11830,Science has gone too far
11831,🔭
11832, F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
11833," It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs."
11834," Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main."
11835, LOX
11836, These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
11837, Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
11838, Probably
11839, Attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow Starship to the launch pad
11840, I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
11841,"High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!"
11842," The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit"
11843," There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine."
11844," O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank"
11845, In the order that they were written
11846,Worth reading Asimov’s Foundation

11867, X will also improve by a similar amount
11868," Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between 373 &amp; 390"
11869," Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +"
11870," There’s a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant."
11871, Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
11872, Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
11873,All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.
11874,Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km

11899,Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
11900," Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
11901, Coming hopefully later this year
11902," I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
11903, Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
11904, Ok

11932," Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."
11933," No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
11934," Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area"
11935," That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
11936," This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."

11979," First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards."
11980," Ok sure 😀 Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."
11981," Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I’m unaware of"
11982," True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature"
11983," It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don’t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo."
11984, Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. It’s *awesome*.
11985, Probably this summer
11986," Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better."
11987, PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
11988,"Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test."
11989," The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks."
11990, Sorry!
11991, A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
11992," Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency"
11993,Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
11994,"We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin"
11995,"Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later."
11996,"Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets"
11997,"Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with"
11998,"“At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn’t just icing on the cake, it the cake” - 

Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me &amp; we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions, not just words, show how critically I view (benign) AI.
"
11999," Unfortunately, this is true. It doesn’t matter how skilled you are if you’re trapped in a giant bureaucracy."
12000, Desperate times call for desperate measures …
12001," Only 66 years from first controlled, powered flight to landing on the moon. Now, half a century later, we are still unable to return. This must change."
12002, Haha true
12003, The safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of Google search results!
12004," Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren’t being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages, they’re just several clicks away."
12005," This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things"
12006, Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.
12007, The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels. This is not cool.
12008, Yes
12009," We should make buildings out of high-strength steel, not concrete (which needs steel in it anyway)"
12010, Nice
12011,Don’t Doubt ur Vibe now on Spotify
12013, I appreciate the kind words!
12014, Those old ladies are wise
12015," Meant to say other forms of “the cold”, not influenza"
12016, There is considerable conflation of diagnosis &amp; contraction of “corona”. Actual virality is much lower than it would seem. I think this will turn out to be comparable to other forms of influenza. World War Z it is not.
12017, I become Tiesto at night

12027,Releasing soon on Emo G Records!
12028," Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 &amp; water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen &amp; Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel."
12029, This number won’t leave me alone! 🤣🤣
12030,Just wrote a song called “Don’t doubt yer vibe”
12031,🕺
12032," Ok, not so bad"
12033, Who is hating on ISRU &amp; why? Doesn’t make sense.
12034,A friend just sent me this excerpt from a Tesla blog I wrote 14 years ago

12047, First two domes of SN1 are almost complete
12048, Yes
12049,Starship 9m test tank made 7.5 bar at room temp! Small leak at a weld doubler. Will be repaired &amp; retested at cryo.

12052, Nice
12053,Meme necromancy
12054," Going with nomenclature of Giga [most widely understood location name] vs Giga #, so Giga Shanghai, Giga Nevada, Giga New York &amp; Giga Berlin"
12055," For sure. Giga Berlin will build sustainable energy vehicles using sustainable energy, so net environmental impact will be extremely positive!"
12056, Yes
12057, Yes
12058, Exactly!
12059, Giga Berlin / GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability and the environment in mind
12060," Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won’t use this much net water on a daily basis. It’s possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event. Also, this is not a natural forest — it was planted for use as cardboard &amp; only a small part will be used for GF4."
12061, V3 Supercharger deployment will accelerate considerably this year
12063," Yeah, system should adapt to most likely destination &amp; anticipate school, then work, if that’s owner preference"
12064, Definitely
12065, Ok
12066," We should have a base on the moon, a city on Mars"
12067, I love that Heart of Gold is moved by Infinite Improbability

12076, Explains the sad lack of progress in candy research!
12077," Yeah, doors are 40 ft wide"
12078," Yeah, we just finished two more propellant domes. SpaceX team &amp; supporting suppliers are doing amazing work ramping Starship production."
12079, Nice shot
12080,Improved Accommodations
12081, Yay!
12082, Would like to take a moment to thank Michael &amp; Ze’ev for helping Tesla. It was very hard work &amp; both could’ve just rested on their laurels. Much appreciated 🍻.
12083, 🤣
12084, Walk this way
12085, Great talking with!
12087," Michael Marks, then Ze’ev Drori, but I helped out as co-CEO as they didn’t have much automotive domain expertise"
12088, Dragon trunk from in-flight abort test is in surprisingly good shape!
12089, Exactly
12090," Thanks on behalf of the  team! Thank you also for the support has provided over the years, without which this would not have happened."
12091, Haha
12092,"Dragon high altitude, supersonic abort test is a risky mission, as it’s pushing the envelope in so many ways"

12097, Yes
12098,Best place to view is from the beach. Excitement guaranteed!
12099,"Dragon Spacecraft supersonic abort test coming up either tomorrow or Sunday, depending on weather"
12100, What should we change?
12101," Munro’s analysis of Tesla engineering is accurate, both pro &amp; con. I think he will appreciate some elements of the Model Y body design."
12102," Even more important for a a reusable rocket, as cost of propellant actually becomes relevant &amp; anything below T/W of 1 is wasted fuel &amp; oxygen"
12103,Hehehe
12104, Helping to pay for this is why I’m accumulating assets on Earth.
12105," Loading the Mars fleet into Earth orbit, then 1000 ships depart over ~30 days every 26 months. Battlestar Galactica …"
12106," Aiming for 20 to 30 years, like aircraft"
12107, Yes. There will be a lot of jobs on Mars!
12108," Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want, with loans available for those who don’t have money"
12109, Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
12110, Yes
12111, That’s the goal
12112, Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
12113," Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit"
12114,Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
12115, That’s about right
12116, Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September
12117," What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
12118," Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
12119," Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy."
12120," Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"
12121," Sorry, migh have brought the site down"
12122,"Starship orbital vehicle SN1, liquid oxygen header tank &amp; nosecone"
12123, Just saw this today. Tesla refunds in general should be easy to get electronically &amp; certainly through customer service. Will he addressed.
12124," Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs &amp; how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun."
12125," Advancing humanity’s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant 🔭 in orbit &amp; on moon. With an occluder, could image 🌏 in other star systems."
12126, One person’s MRI machine is another’s railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
12127," Exactly. We’ve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another, we’ll make sure Starlink doesn’t inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky."
12128,Great song
12129,T-shirt is bulletproof &amp; makes u buff!
12130, Thanks for mentioning! We should’ve done this ages ago.
12131," Good analysis, although a bit conservative imo. However, using a high upper bound for land area that’s *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!"
12132,.@Space_Station
12133, They will
12134, We need more emojis!!
12135,"And, of course, your car will be able to 💨 in their general direction"

12138, Should be able to post video of Raptor on Tripod soon
12139," Ok, tho could be gnarly"

12143, Hard gothic
12144, Haha
12145,We are trapped in a prison of fonts
12146, Yes
12147, Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
12148," Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
12149, A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
12150," Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."
12151, Great idea

12167, Nice 🤣🤣
12168," Since there’s only one main engine, which gives pitch and yaw control, roll control is provided by the nitrogen attitude control thrusters"
12169," Looks like a thin, flat, round UFO on a stick. Starlink Terminal has motors to self-adjust optimal angle to view sky. Instructions are simply:

12195,Rest in peace Syd Mead. Your art will endure.
12196, C tbh
12197," Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque."
12198," Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard"
12199, Headed to Tesla Fremont factory tomorrow to help with vehicle deliveries
12200, Biting off more than I can chew. Because I’m an optimistic fool.
12201, Hard to believe it’s almost time to retire Cargo Dragon after a decade of solid service
12202, Exactly
12203, Will talk about that on Q4 call
12204," Yeah, engineering is ~90% of my time at SpaceX &amp; about ~60% at Tesla"
12205,Barrel on dome

12210, Yes
12211," Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
12212," The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
12213," Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!"
12214," Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn"
12215, Coming …
12216, Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?
12217, We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
12218, Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
12219," Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool."
12220," No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor"
12221, Yeah
12222," Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."
12223," Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction."
12224," We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."
12225,Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣
12226, Haha true
12227, muffin or not-muffin
12228," Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship."
12229," New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there"
12230," Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months"
12231,Simulation of first crewed flight of Falcon 9 / Dragon 2020

12237," I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals &amp; taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues"
12238, Nice
12239," Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!"
12240, Ok
12241," I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue."

12246, What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&amp;D hasn’t improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]
12247," Yeah, Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!"
12248," Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
12249," Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
12250, Pretty much
12251, Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
12252," No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
12253," That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
12254," For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."
12255, Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
12256, Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard.

12261, 🖤 you too
12262, Sounds like a Marxist with style
12263, Exactly
12264," Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone."
12265," This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford."
12266," This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?"
12267," We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).

My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway."
12268," He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"
12269, Pretty much
12270, Federal
12271, Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
12272, Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
12273," Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too."
12274," Yes, but it’s too secret"
12275, Hopefully fully operational in 2020
12276," Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"
12277," No, he’s still much faster 🐌"
12278,"These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them."
12279, Done by dawn
12280, That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣
12281,"Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic"
12282, Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away
12283," We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0."

12288, It is an honor &amp; a privilege to work with so many great engineers
12289, The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
12290," It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
12291, Future feature
12292,"Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
12293," Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!"
12294," Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
12295, We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
12296, Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
12297, Most people still don’t know it’s there
12298,"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
12299," If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"
12300," Merry Christmas 🎄🎁😀
Hope you’re enjoying latest software update!"
12301, Yer welcome son
12302," Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled)."
12303, That is odd. Try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. Have forwarded this to service.
12304, No
12305, Coming soon
12306, They should double down on insanity of Cats. Right move.
12307, Black Mirror
12308, Parasite
12309, True
12310, Needs improvement
12311, Yes
12312, He was awesome. I squared R heating is why room temp superconductors aren’t needed to carry power long distances efficiently. Just jack up voltage.
12313,stock art
12314,Whoa … the stock is so high lol
12315, 🤣🤣
12316," Big communication penalty for remote work, which means the gain in talent that won’t move has to be very high"
12317, Truth
12318," Wow, accurate analysis!"
12319, Good point
12320, Ok ☺️
12321, Don’t wanna brag but … 🚘💨 was me
12322, Henry Cavill +1
12323, Also fake Soundcloud rapper
12324, Write games
12325, Yes
12326," Regarding 2.X to 3 hardware update, that should happen in earnest in Q1. Software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then."
12327," Pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, I’d love it. The real constraint is finding great software engineers."
12328, Ok sure
12329, Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldn’t get it all done in time.
12330," Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever"
12331," My wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. At least it’s obviously not curated! Some day, I should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is 🤣🤣"
12332, Yes 🤣♥️
12333," Started Zip2 with ~$2k &amp; ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I don’t put in mine."
12334,"If Tesla &amp; SpaceX go bankrupt, so will I. As it should be."
12335,"Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. It’s insane! Btw, can someone please delete “investor”. I do basically zero investing."
12336,Pre VFX cut would be $$$$
12337, Another milestone
12338," That’s certainly our impression, but it’s an old version of Tesla software, so effect is limited"
12339, “In-house” 🤣🤣
12340,The real reason for Looper was to travel back in time &amp; stop a terrible calamity — the premiere of Cats!
12341, For sure
12342,Great show 🐼
12343,Holiday gift ideas
12344, We’re working on moving more cars to Florida. End of year delivery is intense! Very proud of Tesla team for all their hard work.
12345, Ok
12346, Yes
12347, Ok
12348, It’s been years
12349, I try so hard with these jokes!
12350, Starfleet begins
12351, For sure!🤞
12352, Orbit is hard. Best wishes for landing &amp; swift recovery to next mission.
12353, Does it like the smiths?
12354," Needs a few more days of validation, then early access, then wide release"
12355,"Tesla holiday software update has FSD sneak preview, Stardew Valley, Lost Backgammon &amp; a few other things"
12356,You don’t hear much about element 43
12357," No, as that’s OG Mobileye hardware"
12358, Cinnamon toast crunch
12359," This is quite a thorny hardware problem, as there are many diff versions of mcu &amp; autopilot computer &amp; supporting hardware. Cars last so much longer than phones! Hopefully able to upgrade mcu1 &amp; ap2.0 in a few months."
12360,This mode will show pic of moth &amp; play the smiths
12361, Lämpe
12362,Tesla Moth Mode (better late than never)
12363," Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars &amp; is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors &amp; antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough."
12364, I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
12365, MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isn’t needed for full self-driving &amp; cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.
12366,"Never trust cynics, as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it"
12367," Yes, probably &amp; partially"
12368, Some good ideas here!
12369," Telemetry indicates soft touchdown on the water, so fairing might still be reusable"
12370, Sigh …
12371," Possibly Excession, but I’d recommend reading Player of Games &amp; Surface Detail first. They’re all great."
12372, Yes
12375, Raptor is making great progress! Just finished an engineering review with SpaceX Propulsion. Engine SN 17 is about to ship to McGregor with some holiday style 🎄😀
12376, Age of Napoleon is excellent
12377, This is how we will view fossil fuel cars
12378, Crossing S-curves standard for tech transitions
12379, Nice to meet you

12381, We are literally a brain in a vat. The vat is your skull. Everything you think is real is an electrical signal. Feels so real though.
12382,"Games only render what you look at when you look at it, as the compute load would otherwise be impossibly high. Until observed, objects are a probability function, aka quantum mechanics."
12383, Blame Minecraft

12385, Plausible
12386,Meant to say “is render speed”. Frame rate is locked.
12387, There are 2 type of people: those who understand binary &amp; those who don’t. And those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke.
12388, Your DLC is $$$$
12389,Way too many paywalls &amp; spawn points
12390," Seriously, the NPC dialog tree should have more options"
12391, Of course
12392,"If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing &amp; the tutorial is way too long"
12393, Sure
12394,Root of energy to mass ratio is max render speed of the simulation
12396,Math jokes have a small audience
12397,Kids these days have no respect!
12398, That’s the one!
12399, It really does
12400," They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It’s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars."
12401," Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed."
12402," Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol."
12403, Maybe on Starship? It’s def got the payload capacity …
12404, Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
12405," Yeah, it’s one of my favorite T-shirts!"
12406," We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17."
12407, Your Twitter comments are great btw!
12408," This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs"
12409, There will be no loss of either
12410," That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width"
12411," True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages."
12412, We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
12413,Speed solves everything
12414," He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs"
12415,"Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels!"
12416, For sure
12417," If we create a city on Mars, Earth-Mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive"
12418,Launching third flight of this Dragon spacecraft to tomorrow
12419, Yes
12420," Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal."

12422,"People often think they’re breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.)"
12423,"Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement"
12424, Still can’t believe how hard it was to get
12425, We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us &amp; then he said yes
12426," Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!"
12427,It’s artificial
12428,Do you like our owl?
12429, Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated
12430, That’s why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control
12431," Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel."
12432, They are dead to me
12433, It’s a generational thing
12434," With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details."

12442,250k
12443," Sure, will aim to do this next week"
12444," Agreed, this will be exciting to see!"
12445," Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation."
12446,Bring it on
12447, Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
12448,200k
12449," Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …"
12450,Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill
12451," Higher hardness, higher strength &amp; doesn’t cost crazy money for ~3mm skins"
12452," In general, this is something Tesla should do"
12453, We should def make it good to hang out there
12454,"Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year"
12455," Good question. It’s a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press."
12456, Can be wrapped in any color!
12457, The body panels will actually be laser cut!
12458," Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too"
12459, Interesting idea
12460, True
12461, 🤣🤣
12462, Really? Ok sure.
12463, Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
12464," Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count."
12465,⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️
12466," We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods."
12467," Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger."
12468,"Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made"
12469,"Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press"
12470,Excellent review by Marques!
12471, Haha v true
12472,With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement
12473,"146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor"
12474, Great analysis

12479,Riding in the Cybertruck
12480, Sure
12481,Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.
12482,🖤🖤🖤 Syd Mead 🖤🖤🖤
12483, We threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event &amp; didn’t even scratch the glass!
12484,"Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911. Order Cybertruck online at"
12485, Yes
12486," Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30."
12487, Tesla 2 person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck
12488, See ya in 2077 😉
12489,Nobody *expects* the Cybertruck
12490, Yup
12491, Haha
12492, High time we had a Tesla coil!
12493, Coming soon! We’re working to complete the full Supercharger route from London to Shanghai.
12494,Tesla Cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars
12495, Of course
12496, Fun party guaranteed!
12497,Long journey
12498,Tonight
12499," Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different."
12500, Maybe won’t need a key at all

12510, True
12511, Not sure. Maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
12512," Even Toyota, who made the Prius. That is sad."
12513, Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
12514, I’d be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. It’s like a kid’s drawing.
12515," Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too."
12516, Exactly! Well said.
12517, Surprisingly common
12518,Cybertruck unveil Thursday night
12519,Innovation comes in many ways
12520, Meaning not fair that Boeing gets so much more for the same thing

12541," Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species"
12542, Bad logic is always ugly
12543, Same goes for digital super intelligence denial
12544, 😘
12545,141 MPGe!
12546, Yes
12547, Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
12548," SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
12549," Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
12550, Pretty much
12551," Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
12552," No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
12553," So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
12554, As the planets align only once every two years
12555, A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
12556, No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
12557," Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
12558," If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
12559," Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
12560, The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
12561, Gas/diesel cars too
12562, True
12563,Extremism is so fun! (@waitbutwhy)
12564, Yes
12565,The date is strangely familiar …
12566,Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
12567, Looking into it
12568, Yes
12569," The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF"
12570, Naturally
12571, This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
12572," Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
12573, More to come
12574, Yes
12575, Would be odd to expect anything else
12576," That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
12577," Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
12578, Great poem
12579,"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row."
12580," Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!"
12581,"Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃 
Happy Halloween!!"
12582," Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong"
12583," Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races."
12584, Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
12585,Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
12586, Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
12587, The fires are all too real
12588, Haha true
12589, …
12590," Hard to say with high accuracy, but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess"
12591,"Soon, SpaceX will launch astronauts to!"
12592, That’s significantly improved in current production
12593," True, my name literally means tree"
12594," If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if you’re home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if that’s in wide release yet, but def in early access. It’s an awesome feature."
12595,"“I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill.”"
12596,For Treebeard
12597," Ok, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees"
12598, Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
12599, Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
12600," We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc"
12601," Very true. Glass doesn’t burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs."
12602, I hate advertising
12603,"Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to to add solar to an existing roof &amp; for a new roof with integrated solar."
12604,"We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot"
12605,"If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today"
12606,"Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires"
12607, So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
12608,"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. "
12609, I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
12610, Extremely high
12611, Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
12612,"US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time"
12613,Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery backup for 24/7 clean energy &amp; no blackouts at
12614, Sure
12616,Took my son to play piano for the seniors home in Pasadena. It was lovely to see them smile ♥️
12617, Thanks to everyone at Tesla who worked so hard over the years to make our Fremont factory successful!
12618,Sandwich time travel is the only explanation
12619,Physics facts
12620," Yes, you can walk on the Tesla Solarglass roof. In stilettos, if you want 😉"

12627," That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!"
12628,"Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!"
12629," Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly."
12630,🔥
12631," Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth."
12632,"To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended"
12633," This product may appear simple, but actually *very* difficult to get right"
12634,Will do an open call Q&amp;A
12635, Major FUD incoming for sure … haha
12636, 🤣🤣
12637," I have V1, but will switch to V3"
12638,Tesla Solar Tile Roof V3 launch tomorrow at 2pm
12639, Sure
12640,But actually …
12641,Super proud of Tesla team for great execution &amp; support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!
12642,"Tesla Q3 results:

- Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule
- Model Y ahead of schedule
- Solar installs +48% from Q2
- GAAP profitable
- Positive free cash flow"
12643," Internal camera isn’t used yet (meant for robotaxi), but that’s a good idea"
12644, Please lmk about your experience and what can be improved
12645, Coming soon
12646,"Whoa, it worked!!"
12647,Sending this tweet through space via Starlink satellite 🛰
12648,"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow"
12649,"More carrot, less stick"
12650,"Very likely that a home with clean power that’s lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value"
12651,PG&amp;E says rolling blackouts expected in California for next 10 years!
12652,Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no blackouts!
12653,Going offline for a few days
12654, Both at the same time!
12655, More about dealing with failure modes &amp; roll control
12656," Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well."
12657," Common myth, but incorrect"
12658, And so begins the robocalypse …
12659,Tesla wins best headlights award 🥇
12660," The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track"
12661,Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
12662, Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
12663,"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …"
12664," Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
12665," Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
12666,And the lead character is also named Woody
12667," Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
12668, Conservation of energy tells you the answer
12669, Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
12670," We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower."
12671," Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
12672," Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
12673," Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
12674, Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.
12675," This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass."
12676," Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
12677," We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces."
12678," Yeah, great team!"
12679," To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth."
12680," Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
12681," Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."
12682," Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …"
12683, Software
12684, Yes
12685, Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
12686, Venus would be very difficult
12687, True
12688," Yes, we will"
12689," It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers."
12690," Deep Rain™️ neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep."
12691, ♥️ hot pot
12692, Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.
12693, Those rumors are false
12694, Coming v soon
12695,Haha
12696,Ms. Chief &amp; Ms. Tree
12697, lol
12698,Space Jam should’ve won the Oscar
12699, Recommended for sure. Both movies are incredible.
12700,"First will rewatch Godfather Part II, then Space Jam"
12701,"Underappreciated 🎥, will watch!"
12702,Is Space Jam good?
12703, So it goes
12704, Sure looks that way
12705, Nice 🤣🤣
12706, Solar
12707," Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess"
12708," Whoa, that does look good!"
12709, Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
12710,French fries 🍟 are the devil 😈
12711," .@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?"
12712, Super messed up situation!
12713, Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
12714, Should be much better at this point
12715,Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
12716," Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …"
12717," Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
12718," When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car."
12719, Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
12720, 😉
12721," Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
12722," Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive."
12723,"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1"
12724,Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts!
12725, Will be throughout Canada
12726, Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future
12727, True 🤣🤣
12728, I ♥️ Asterix &amp; Obelix!
12729, Ok
12730,Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts.
12731,Sooo annoying!!
12733, We’re changing Powerwall Storm Watch to Disaster Watch. Covers more bases.
12734, 🚀🚘 🧠🕳
12735, Yes
12736, No change
12737, Important for Moonbase Alpha!
12738, Working on it
12739, Even Gary likes it!
12740,It’s really quite fun!

12755," Not easily, as requires wire harness changes"
12756, 🦶 💨
12757, I’m in the credits
12758,Worth reading “Human Compatible” by Stuart Russell (he’s great!) about future AI risks &amp; solutions
12759, All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
12760," We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts."
12761," For what it’s worth, the SpaceX schedule, which I’ve just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon &amp; Dragon at the Cape &amp; all testing done in ~10 weeks"
12762, 🤣
12763, Culture Class is really something
12764, I hope so
12765, We’re doomed!
12766, Hāhā
12767, Haha true
12768, Done
12769,Trouble!
12770,And that’s just the tip of the iceberg
12771, Agreed
12772, Good ones
12773," Agreed, fair point"
12774, Any feature requests?
12775,"Given how quickly the world is shifting to electric vehicles, a gas/diesel vehicle bought today will probably have low resale value"
12776, Will consider
12777, Sure
12778,"Customized horn &amp; movement sounds (coconuts being one, of course) coming to Teslas soon"
12779, Haha
12780, We will understand the next question

12786,Excited about launching asteroid defense mission! #Armageddon69
12787, Let’s go boyz!
12788, Sorry it took so long!
12789," Wow, cool! Summon will get steadily smoother until it’s like an expert chauffeur who knows you well."
12790, Welded steel
12791,Rosetta by Vangelis is incredible
12792," Not sure, will ask regulators"
12793, Enhanced should get it too
12794, Aiming for this weekend!
12795," Hopefully, a month or two, although it may be a little silly at first"
12796, Not yet
12797, First point release update expected to go out this weekend
12798,"Over 550,000 Tesla Smart Summon uses in first few days!"
12799," Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest it’s ever been &amp; doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them."
12800," If 20km works, then orbit"
12801, Great summary of the key points!
12802," That’s about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced."
12803," It’s all the “secondary” structure that concerns me, not engines &amp; primary airframe"
12804," Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is &lt;$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie &lt;$1000/ton"
12805, Agreed &amp; such a heartwarming photo ♥️
12806, I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
12807, Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
12808, Lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts.
12809, Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel.
12810,"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"
12811, Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back
12812, Haha yes
12813," In solving for a good Mars climate, we will learn a great deal about how to do so on Earth. It is the inverse problem."
12814,Inside Starship cargo bay. Header tanks mounted in tip of nosecone to offset engine weight at rear.
12815, Cool video!
12816," Probably our most viral feature ever. Most of the Autopilot team has been working on this, led by Ashok, CJ, Andrej &amp; many others."
12817, 😀
12818,"Rage, rage against the dying of the light"
12819," We’re going to use the pedestrian pink noise speaker to talk to people &amp; create customized horn sounds. “I beg your pardon, but would you be so kind as to allow me to proceed?” Said in the voice of Mr. Darcy."
12820," Special light pattern (but not hazards, as they’re too shrill) seems right"
12821, Makes sense
12822, Precisely
12823,To make life as we know it multiplanetary
12824,Starship will allow us to inhabit other worlds
12825,Starship halves being joined
12826,Summon is improving rapidly 
12827, There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
12828, Yes
12829," No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight."
12830, Probably around 6 or 7pm
12831," What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber &amp; nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or ~12,000 psi"
12832, Figure of speech
12833,"Meanwhile, back in reality"
12834, Media report was false
12835, Raptor uses milled copper channels with an inconel jacket all the way down
12836,Three Raptors on a Starship
12837," Wow, it’s been 5 years since we started at Boca!"
12838," About a week. Will include slight improvements, based on initial user feedback."
12839," We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build, then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. So, soon, but hard to say exactly."
12840," Gary, you rock!"
12841,Tesla V10.0 just started rolling out to all US Tesla owners with FSD option &amp; “advanced download” selected in vehicle software settings

12843,"Anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer examination. If they’re evolving rapidly, something’s up."
12844,"If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasn’t been applied to manipulate social media, it won’t be long before it is"
12845, Exactly
12846, That would be a nice touch
12847," This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so"
12848, Haha awesome
12849, We could probably do that
12850, 50m
12851," Not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at user’s discretion"
12852," With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They don’t stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great."
12853," Mk1 ship is around 200 tons dry &amp; 1400 tons wet, but aiming for 120 by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is 5000 tons."
12854, Absolutely
12855, You’re welcome! Feature requests always appreciated.
12856," Six. Two windward, one under each fin &amp; two leeward. Provides redundancy for landing on unimproved surfaces."

12863," Almost entirely C++, but we did have an (advanced for the time) client-side Java app for viewing maps &amp; (weirdly) a 3D hockey game in VRML"
12864, Turbo Pascal
12865," Mostly C/C++, Python &amp; SQL"
12866, It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
12867," This includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization."
12868," Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car"
12869," For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise."
12870," Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust"
12871," Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing."
12872," Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."
12873," It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating"
12874," Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th."
12875," That’s correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver."
12876," Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it’s worth, he has my support."

12887,Just leaving SpaceX Starship build site in Boca
12888," Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver."
12889, 😉
12890, Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
12891," For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure."
12892," Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
12893," Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."
12894, Stability is not an issue with 3
12895," Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom."
12896," Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out."
12897,"Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas"
12898, Thanks!
12899,"Either way, sustainable energy wins!!"
12900, srsly
12901, It’s my 🔥 glasses 😉
12902," Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term."

12971," Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
12972," That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
12973," At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
12974," The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
12975, Agreed
12976," Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
12977," There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
12978," Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
12979," Hopefully, next year"
12980," Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8"
12981, Sagan was awesome
12982, They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your … along the Thames River in London
12983, Haha exactly!
12984, Yes
12985," Yes, that’s exactly what I meant, Gary the Bot!"
12986,Tesla commercial solar ordering now live at
12987, At least they had great cigars 👍
12988, Ahem
12989, A Speedraptor is a Velociraptor with no sense of direction (that’s how you can them apart)
12990, This is technically a Speedraptor
12991," Autopilot active crash prevention keeps getting better, as we examine every crash for improvement &amp; then upload smarter software. Ironically, I hope we’re never on the list!"
12992, v^2/r is fun haha
12993," Makes it clear that you can only sense acceleration, not velocity"
12994, The downward spiral …
12995, Good point
12996, To carry 7 people
12997,Model S at Nürburgring has 7 seats
12998, All great! ♥️ Mel Brooks
12999, Spaceballs
13000, Flux capacitor option package
13001, Yes
13002, Soon
13003," Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production &amp; applies to S,X &amp; Roadster, but not 3 or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors."
13004, No
13005,The only thing beyond Ludicrous is Plaid
13006, A Flock of Bricks
13007, Next year
13008, Cuphead
13009, Of course
13010, Polytopia
13011, This could be good
13012," But we probably won’t try for best lap time this week, as we need to review &amp; tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nürburgring, especially Flugplatz section"
13013, Model S is already there
13014,"Model S just set record for fastest 4 door ever at Laguna Seca, video tmrw"
13015, 🤣🤣
13016,DMT FTW
13017,Getting ready for flight of orbit-class Starship design
13018, Aargh!!
13019," No, but that was an epic piece at a time when the word was being overrun by demented versions of an otherwise delightful jam container. It was like World War Z, but mason jars …"
13020, I’d love to
13021,obv
13022, 👍
13023, For sure!
13024,♥️♥️🇮🇸🇮🇸 Ísland 🇮🇸🇮🇸♥️♥️
13025, Will be answered on 28th
13026, Exactly
13027, Looks good
13028, The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
13029, 48 61 20 68 61
13030," The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
13031," Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
13032, Precisely
13033," Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok."
13034, 🤣🤣
13035, You know destination weather before departure &amp; there’s no weather in space
13036," Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins."
13037," Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
13038," Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability."
13039," Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult"
13040, Most likely
13041, Photoshop is amazing
13042," Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle"
13043, For sure
13044, Actually true
13045," Ceres, Callisto, Ganymede &amp; Titan"
13046,And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
13047, Deep lore
13048, Hoping to open in Romania soon!
13049, Definitely
13050,Probability that we’re in base Polytopia is highly unlikely - KWM
13051, Wow cool
13052,Why aren’t more people talking about this!?
13053, Sounds about right
13054, It’s not
13055," Over time, it will be 100% sustainable"
13056,Hadouken!!
13057," Offer me money, offer me power …"
13058,Also
13059,"Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!)"
13060,"For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains."
13061, Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.
13062," Very exciting to see India’s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall."
13063, Yes
13064," Thanks for offering! Sure, that would be great."
13065, We might be in one right now
13066," No, probably V10.1"
13067," Merging code branches &amp; one more QA-level release this week. Hopefully, EAP wide release week after."
13068, 🥳
13069, For sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason
13070," Wanted to build an electric car company in college. Was going to do PhD at Stanford in electric energy storage (ultracaps), but got distracted for a few years by the Internet."
13071, 10 years ago …
13072, November most likely
13073, We’re almost there
13074,Tesla doing laps at Nerdburgering
13075,But Taycan does seem like a good car. Nürburgring track time is great.
13076, Sounds sweaty
13077, 😲
13078, A Neuralink could increase this by several orders of magnitude
13079, Uh no
13080, 🤗
13081," Legs, but this render isn’t accurate"
13082," In some of those, I’m even funny"
13083, 🤔
13084,Model S on Nürburgring next week
13085," Also, cars are called “automobiles”"
13086, Jalopnik not sharpest tool in shed …
13087,"Um, this word Turbo does not mean what you think it does"
13088, Looking into it
13089," Yes, and it ♥️♥️♥️ irony"
13090," Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week."
13091, It’s up to 🇳🇴 &amp; 🇳🇱 as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
13092," Same, except where limited by EU regulations. We’re aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this &amp; are working with EU regulators to address."
13093," In close traffic, poisonous gas spewing from the car in front of you goes straight into your AC intake. Good thing gas/diesel carmakers didn’t cheat on their emissions or we’d be in real trouble 😅"
13094, Nice
13095, Gasoline is designed to burn
13096, Anywhere insurance prices are high
13097," Yeah, several. Smart Summon most significant."
13098, Both 🍀 and 😋 buttons in V10.0
13099, Yup
13100, Yes
13101, Definitely
13102,"Try Tesla Insurance. Should be ~20% less than avg. Currently only in California, but expanding soon. Critical feedback much appreciated."
13103, Opening on 9/9
13104, Slowpoke! Didn’t even finish his hypothesis …
13105,Haha actually true
13106, So good!
13108, Exactly
13109, Coming soon. Version 10.1 at latest.
13110, Yes
13111, 🇮🇸 Iceland 🇮🇸 for sure!
13112," Very soon, sorry for the delay"
13113," Aiming for 20km flight in Oct &amp; orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept 28th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time."
13114, Probably 2 to 3 months. We’re about to ship Raptor SN 10.
13115, Probably 18m for next gen system
13116," Would love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles"
13117, Should be. Will fix.
13118,"Also, u can order online at in 2 mins, have car delivered to ur doorstep &amp; return for full refund"
13119, Can’t believe it’s been 6 years since our first vertical landing!
13120, Core body diameter is 9m/30ft
13121,R2D2’s Dad
13122, Empty article?
13123,One day Starship will land on the rusty sands of Mars
13124,Congrats SpaceX team!!
13125,About to do next Starhopper flight test
13126,Dragon Crew Arm. Astronauts will walk this gantry to enter Dragon &amp; depart for the.
13127,Dronship with wings folded traveling through Panama Canal
13128, Interesting
13129, Not that I know of
13130," Yes, rather embarrassing tbh"
13131, Impressively accurate analysis!
13132, Hopefully next year
13133, ♥️♥️♥️
13134, Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
13135,Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.
13136," Raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. Better long-term, but more finicky in development."
13137,About 5 mins from flight attempt
13138,Starhopper flight currently tracking to 5pm Texas time for 150m / ~500ft hover test
13139," Finally, VR that’s cool *and* sexy!"
13140, Oh behave u naughty planet … 😉
13141, 😢
13142, It’s quite robust
13143, Where are additional Superchargers most needed?
13144,World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well
13145," Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor."
13146, Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
13147," Agreed, that’s the right future"
13148,Looks like Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
13149, We’re working closely with EU regulators &amp; hope to clarify the timeline soon
13150, Ok
13151, Should be soon
13152,"If you’re a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment &amp; usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants!"
13153," Yes, probably within next 6 to 9 months"
13154, Tesla is working hard to help stop global warming
13155, 🤣🤣👍👍
13156, The Nude Scientisté
13157, Looks like a wheel of cheese
13158, Ok
13159," We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks"
13160, Wow
13161, Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
13162,"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
13163," Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun)."
13164," True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky."
13165,"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
13166," Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
13167, Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
13168," Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming"
13169, 🤣🤣
13170,Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
13171," AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based."
13172," Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters"
13173," Initially Model 3, later Y"
13174, Looking forward to seeing Giga Shanghai soon 😀 Amazing work by Tesla China team &amp; support of authorities much appreciated!
13175, Not yet
13176, This is a great idea
13177, 🤣🤣
13178, Um I ate most of it
13179,Cookie decorating contest with kids
13180,Converts about 5 million tons of mass to energy every second
13181,"Great name! Wouldn’t worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually &amp; we currently have no defense."
13182," Don’t know yet, but it’s important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so we’ll make costs as low as possible"
13183,One click to order solar &amp; save ~$500/year in utility bills with no long-term contract (cancel anytime)
13184, Next year
13185,"With the new lower Tesla pricing, it’s like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious."
13186,Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think …
13187,Which means a small corner of Texas  (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
13188,1 Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earth’s surface
13189, In a few years
13190," Yeah, legs are hydraulic pistons &amp; abdomen is the accumulator"
13191,Generates a *lot* of energy
13192, It is quite silly
13193, Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
13194," Aspirationally, decades"
13195,The sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion fyi
13196, Yes
13197," Yeah, the trick is opening &amp; closing the spacesuit helmet really fast"
13198, Stop hashtagging me 🤣
13199,Perhaps that one was too edgy …
13200,Hashtags are an abomination
13202,Nuking Mars one T-shirt at a time
13203, Simulations all the way down
13204,"Trust me, it will be 🔥🔥"
13205,"Hey babe, fancy a hot date …? 😉"
13206, It’s not boring …
13207, Of course!
13208,T-shirt soon
13209, Guess I sort of am already
13210, I’d play that game
13211,Nuke Mars!
13212, This isn’t correct. Will address.
13213, Good conversation with head of FAA Space. Need a bit more hazard analysis &amp; should be clear to fly soon.
13214, Am talking to in a few hours
13215," Stacking fairing &amp; tanks soon, then adding control fins, engines &amp; landing gear"
13216, That was my actual password at one point!
13217, Stop posting my password on twitter!
13218, Coming
13219," Tesla audio engineers come from B&amp;O &amp; many other companies. They literally rōq. Our system is highly programmable, so we keep improving it via OTA codec updates."
13220, We’ll take care of it
13221,Corporate Surrealism™️
13222, Not yet
13223,fyi
13224, 🤣
13225,heh heh
13226, True
13227,No but srsly don’t do it
13228, Roughly
13229, Ok
13230, Possibly two weeks
13231,Try playing Powerglide in your Tesla at volume 11
13232, Working on upgrades to Sentry …
13233, No plans to introduce air suspension on Model 3 at this time
13234,"Watching a movie on Tesla V10.0 is great, in large part due to the sound system"
13235, Obviously needed
13236, He would our first openly goth president. I think this is very important.
13237, I support Yang
13238, When Opportunity knocks …
13239,Passing fad. Like steam engines. They look cool in a museum.
13240, Because our universe is actually a microverse in a miniverse. We probably just power someone’s brake lights.
13241," Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge 🤣🤣"
13242," Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes"
13243," Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real."
13244," Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B"
13245," Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels"
13246, Yes
13247, Between $100B and $10T
13248, Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
13249, For sure
13250, Yup
13251, Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
13252,Gas cars are so last-century!
13253, Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
13254," We’re accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!"
13255," Probably every 2 to 4 months, depending on how much progress we make"
13256, Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!
13257, FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
13258, Thanks for reminding me. Will rectify.
13259, Tons of fun!
13260,Tesla software V10 is lookin real good! Releasing to early access list soon …
13261, 🤔
13262, Pot kettle 😀
13263," Don’t know enough about George’s company, but it sounds like he’s focused on a machine vision approach, which is the only general solution imo"
13264," Yeah, George is a little nuts, but I like him &amp; he often has interesting things to say"
13265, No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
13266," Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights."
13267,Thanks George!
13268," We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world."
13269, But actual road data is what matters most
13270," Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident."
13271," Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …"
13272, Well said!
13273, Ok
13274,🎶 Strangers in the Night 🎶
13275,Rocket fairing falling from space (higher res)
13276,And really knows cars!
13277,Rocket fairing falls from space &amp; is caught by Ms Tree boat
13278,"Fairing caught, video posting soon"
13279,Hoping to catch the fairing in a few mins
13280," Race to orbit by both teams, although a success by both in close proximity would be amazing &amp; each would count as a win"
13281, Details coming at Starship update
13282," Not in current plans, but that may change"
13283, No
13284," Vandenberg is great for polar orbits. Will still play an important role long-term, but 80%+ will be eastward."
13285,"Great progress by Starship Cape team. Started several months behind, but catching up fast. This will be a super fun race to orbit, moon &amp; Mars!"
13286," So much drama &amp; good times too! Maybe worth a book one day, but would come at expense of 🚀 &amp; 🚘 &amp; 🧠."
13287,Headed to Starship Cape Canaveral build site today
13288,"Lyft/Uber/taxi drivers are expert Tesla advocates. Thanks for your support!!
"
13289, Yes
13290, Progress is accelerating

13295, It’s all about branding
13296, The best guide by far!
13297, Will Dojo to be the difference
13298, That is a great guide 👍
13299, philosophically
13300,"His name is Eric, of course"
13301, It’s about time I suppose
13302, Mad skillz
13303, Yes
13304,Fred Astaire &amp; Ginger Rogers👌
13305, True
13306,I ♥️ Top Hat

13308,🐝 all u can 🐝
13309," Oh my, what a dashingly handsome hat you have!"
13310, The lost art of entomological haberdashery &amp; millinery …
13311, I dare say that 🐝 could use a nice 🎩
13312," Yes, detailed review of the first orbital Starship, explaining the pros &amp; cons of each design decision"
13313, We are tiny
13314," Very convincing! Ok, Boca it is. We should have Starship Mk1 with 3 Raptors almost ready to fly by then."
13315, I would’ve been bankrupt too. Unlikely investors would have funded a second attempt.
13316, Relief
13317," Ok, will discuss with team"
13318, Sure
13319," Also, you can request any service from the Tesla phone app in under a minute"
13320," August 24th, either at Cape Canaveral or Boca Chica"
13321," That was our last chance to reach orbit. If it had failed, SpaceX would have died."
13322, Yes
13323, Will also be launching The Boring Company China on this trip
13324, Good idea
13325, You’re most welcome!
13326,Fates loves irony
13327," For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes."
13328, Not sure. Will check with my team.
13329," I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable."
13330," Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first."
13331, Fixing …
13332, Depot haha
13333, Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
13334, Never thought we’d make it this far
13335, Spooling up production line rapidly. Hoping to manufacture ~1000 solar roofs/week by end of this year.
13336,Tesla Megapack now available for utility-scale energy storage
13337," Thanks Jason! Super proud to work with such great teams at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and Boring!!"
13338,Falcon rocket reentry from space with double sonic booms
13339,"Now that Hopper has flown, Starship update probably in two weeks or so."
13340,Falcon 9 piercing the sound barrier on reentry
13341, Thanks for letting me know
13342, You can
13343, Vehicle alert seen show up automatically &amp; enable single touch request for service for that item either from the car screen or mobile app
13344, System automatically selects between mobile service &amp; service center appointment. Say prefer mobile in comments to bias. We will add a check box for mobile preferred.
13345,Tesla owners can schedule service appointments in under a minute just using their Tesla phone app!
13346," We’re working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too."
13347, Sure
13348," Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August"
13349, Tesla Service Centers &amp; a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year
13350, Will recognize &amp; read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights &amp; stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
13351," Hoping to get “Joe Mode” into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting “Joe Mode” would lower the volume of strident beeps &amp; chimes by half."
13352," If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release"
13353, Yes
13354, Some
13355," Not currently in V10, but will try"
13356," Yes, V10 will include several games &amp; infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light &amp; stop sign recognition &amp; Smart Summon"
13357, Can’t you just play though phone Bluetooth?
13358," We’re close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months."
13359," Maybe August, not more than a few months"
13360," Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound"
13361,"When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving"
13362,"Ability to stream YouTube &amp; Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats &amp; surround sound audio."
13363," Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish she’d made it up to sky city"
13364," Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatever’s most fun!"
13365, And those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke
13366, Will run v high res at 60 fps. Cuphead doesn’t need 4k.
13367, Cuphead for Tesla coming out in August

13374, Yes
13375, 200m hop in a week or two
13376,Starhopper flight successful. Water towers *can* fly haha!!
13377," Btw, you can schedule service via the Tesla app in less than a minute"
13378, Good point. Getting fixed …
13379, Probably 1/4 to 1/2 of that capacity would be for stationary storage
13380, Launch underway
13381,"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
13382, Pc (chamber pressure) high due to colder than expected propellant
13383, Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
13384," Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe."
13385, Wearing black not recommended
13386," High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective."

13395, Center 7 engines gimbal to 15 degrees
13396, 🤝
13397," Outer engines stick out slightly from 9m diameter, don’t gimbal &amp; are mechanically joined at nozzle"
13398," To be clear: good for in-space transit, but not recommended for Earth to orbit!"
13399, Very unlikely
13400, Goodbye 😢
13401, Nuclear thermal rocket for fast transit around solar system would be a great area of research for
13402, Do EV owners use V to G a lot in Australia?

13419, Won’t change. Starship launch structure will be attached to the other side from tower.
13420, Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
13421, 2 to 3 months after that
13422, It *is* vision
13423, I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Won’t be subtle.
13424, Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in 2 to 3 months
13425,Made with rain ™️
13426, Coming soon
13427, Yes
13428,Tesla Service Centers &amp; Superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across Eastern Europe
13429," This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket &amp; space station technology. Great respect."
13430," No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot"
13431," Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you’d expect."
13432, Maybe end of next year
13433, Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
13434," Post test fuel leak, but no major damage"
13435, Aiming for hover test next week
13436," Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!"
13437," This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features"
13438, Good piece
13439, I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer. Our new Raven powertain &amp; adaptive damping suspension is great! Next is Model 3P &amp; then X if driving with my kids. Acceleration is fun on tap!

13457,"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
13458, Probably
13459, Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
13460,Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
13461," Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them &amp; we won’t be able to."
13462," No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
13463," If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
13464, Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.
13465,Presentation streaming live from at 8pm Pacific
13466, Streaming. Check Neuralink website later today. Starts around 8pm.
13467," Won’t be today, hopefully tomorrow"

13476, SpaceX thruster package will be subtle. Hidden behind license plate.
13477, Haha yes
13478," Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers."
13479," Yeah, that’s next after summon"
13480," Will trace back inertial measurements &amp; wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"
13481," Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year"
13482, Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
13483, Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
13484, Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
13485," Agreed, it’s a small, but important, feature"
13486, Ok
13487,🔥
13488,"Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs "
13489, Take note
13490," About right, but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at 40%. We’ll keep it above 50% for this flight."
13491," More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2, as I recall, but doesn’t matter, as there’s no geo 🛰 anywhere near that mass."
13492, 3
13493," 100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never."
13494, Cont of main
13495, We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
13496,~20m up &amp; sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully 20km up in a few months.

13518, No
13519, No
13520, This shampoo sounds amazing
13521, No problem
13522, The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.
13523, May the light of consciousness shine bright
13524," Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising."
13525, Exactly
13526, Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
13527," To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
13528," Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time, thousands."
13529, Upgrading to 250kW soon
13530," Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety."
13531, Local supporters will be invited!
13532, Yes
13533, ~Q4 2016
13534," End of Q4, most likely"
13535," Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
13536, This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars
13537, All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer

13571, Is this true?
13572," FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years."
13573," Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines"
13574," Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves."

13588,"If you don’t already know what a merkin is, don’t google it. You have been warned."
13589,Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin 🤣🤣
13590," We poured our heart &amp; soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Fabergé egg of cars."
13591," Hardly anyone noticed, but still"
13592, We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
13593, 2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
13594, That’s actually kinda true
13595, Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
13596, You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
13597," That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
13598," ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
13599," About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
13600," Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
13601," Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work."
13602, Probably sooner
13603, Ok
13604," Sure, that would be an honor"
13605, Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
13606, High entry force &amp; heat breached engine bay &amp; center engine TVC failed
13607," Ok, thanks"
13608, :(
13609, Working on Tesla global logistics
13610, I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
13611," Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well."
13612,Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
13613, High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
13614, Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
13615, He was the real deal
13616, One of our main conference rooms at SpaceX is named after Goddard
13617," No, it’s along the way"

13634," Yes, the droids can now hold down the center core"

13636, 🖤 Tesla Software Engineering 🖤
13637,Falcon Heavy on LC-39A
13638," All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗"
13639, It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
13640," Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
13641," Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
13642, Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
13643, So cool
13644, Anything with high contrast
13645, Excessive shades of grey
13646," Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
13647, Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
13648, Haha
13649, Depends on destination
13650," Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"
13651," Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
13652, Chomsky sucks
13653,"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite"
13654,Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
13655," More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
13656," Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
13657," Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."
13659," For sure moon 1st, as it’s only 3 days away &amp; u don’t need interplanetary orbital synchronization"

13705, I’ve been tweeting strange shit since Ramses II. He was a great pharaoh!
13706, Might get pushed to next month. Starhopper flight first. Waiting on engine repair.
13707," 10 years ago, SpaceX server room was named Skynet as a joke. Fate 🖤 irony."
13708, Thanks 😀
13709,Model 3 arriving in UK
13710, Good question. Will consider thoughtful response.
13711, By far
13712," Good analysis. Both computers will be used &amp; sync ~20 times per second. This is a long time to a computer. Like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one."
13715,Falcon Rising
13716, BG2 was so good
13717," No need, Top Gear already did"
13718, The Ass Blade of Vengeance!
13719, Weird that this actually happened. Music makes a big difference.
13720,"Unlike bees, who are experts in millinery"
13721,"Truth is a metaphorical concept with no footwear or clothing of anything kind. Also, baby don’t hurt me haha "
13722," Yes, excessively configurable seats almost always make things worse, rather than better. Too complex &amp; unwieldy."
13723," Cool, that’s the way it should be!"
13724,Can’t fool me it was 1669
13725, Sounds about right
13726, Don’t make me challenge you to a rap battle!!
13727, Fair point
13728," Yeah, dual motor AWD is super fun!"
13729, 😉
13730, RWD with all-weather tires works great. Tesla traction control is an order of magnitude more precise than gas/diesel. Really helps to have Newton &amp; Maxwell on your side.
13731, Thanks Bob! He is a tough critic.
13732,"“Not only was the paint without any discernible flaw, but the various panels formed a body of precision that was beyond reproach”"

13735,Tesla Solar Toof Tile V3.0 starting early trials
13736, Exactly
13737, (muffled titter)
13738, Haha
13739, Would be good to look up electricity rates by location &amp; optimize cost automatically
13740," Yeah, they were a little off the mark"
13741, Fun!
13742," Applies to a small number of Bay Area residents, but worth checking out"
13743,🧲 is relativistic side effect of ⚡️
13744, Strong incentive to make up &amp; promote negative news
13745,"True, cost of operating a Tesla is much lower than other cars"
13746,Landing in the fog
13747, Fear (and memes) get clicks
13748," Storm Watch was active for hundreds of Powerwall customers this weekend as a result of Red Flag Fire Warnings in California, and we will continue to activate it whenever there advance awareness of a potential power outage or physical danger"
13749, Absolutely agree. Major expansion of service centers underway.
13750, Super fair criticism. We’re putting max resources on this. Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway! Please apply if interested.
13751,💖🇳🇴 Norway 🇳🇴💖
13752," Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater, add a little antifreeze in cold climates &amp; make it last for years."
13753, Annual tire rotation is actually optional. Only worthwhile if you see significant differential wear on inside vs outside of tire.
13754, ♥️
13755, Yes
13756,Upcoming Falcon Heavy 🚀 &amp; 🛰 details
13757, China EV subsidies mostly end this month &amp; fully end in about 7 months
13758, Yes
13759, No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. It’s great to get thoughtful criticism.
13760," 155mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only 5 offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to 31mph."
13761, Tesla Superchargers &amp; service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year
13762," Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings"
13763," Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. That’s 57,600/hour/lane &amp; you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput &amp; convenience."
13764, Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.
13765, Exactly
13766," We’re trying to simplify product complexity, so only offering white (technically black &amp; white) interior in high volume markets"
13767, Science 😀👍
13768, Read it on
13769, 😀

13777," Also HEPA filter is expensive, so would force increase in price"
13778, Same
13779, Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk. Model S &amp; X primary HEPA filter alone is literally 1000% bigger than normal car air filter.
13780, S/X HEPA filter is one of my favorite features
13781,Model 3 Performance
13782, Feedback received. Restoring white interior.
13783, 🤣
13784, Thoughtful model
13785," Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further"
13786, Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto &amp; oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors &amp; space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
13787," Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20."
13788," Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."
13789, Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn’t affect schedule much though.
13790, Not bad
13791, Exactly. We’re on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
13792," Yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights"
13793, I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
13794," One day’s grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow."
13795, Edgy move
13796, Good idea
13797, True. I’m a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
13798, Yup
13799, Would love to do exactly that
13800," Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun."
13801," Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
13802, Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
13803," Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy."
13804," Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
13805," If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map."
13806," There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible."
13807," No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
13808, Fair
13809, Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
13810, Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
13811," Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
13812," Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."
13813, Whoa cool 😀
13814, Yes
13815,Beautiful solar sail
13816, ISS is extremely gigantic &amp; has lights
13817," Precisely, sats will be in darkness when stars are visible"

13821,“Stop sending me this étron” - Audi
13822,Great ad
13823, This is complete nonsense
13824, Exactly. A car being electric &amp; upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value.
13825, It’s not my finest work 🤣
13826," Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this."
13827,💨 &amp; 🌌
13828, 👍
13829," Krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every 90 mins"
13830, No
13831, 🤣🤣 Absolutely
13832," Yes, 3 to 6 months"
13833, Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
13834,Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
13835,Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
13836," Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
13837," Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn’t matter"
13838, Paperwork &amp; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
13839," LA has a subway, but most people don’t know about it"
13840, That would great!
13841, Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!
13842,Boring Company guide to why tunnels are awesome &amp; safest place to be in an earthquake
13843," So far, so good"
13844," Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They can’t *both* be true!"
13845, Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
13846,Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
13847, This is simple and just works
13848, Pretty much

13853," Thanks! Yeah, that’s pretty close."
13854,Launch in 3 mins
13855,"New S &amp; X are much improved. Worth trying out. You’re on version 2, current S/X is version 4."
13856, It’s smart *and* enhanced!
13857,Smart Summon coming soon!
13858," Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket"
13859," Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that aren’t"
13860," Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full."
13861, Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
13862, ~2.8m
13863," Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber."
13864, Horizontally
13865," First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20."
13866, So it goes
13867, 3 months
13868," Hopefully, 4 months"
13869, Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
13870," Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees"
13872, Sure
13873, Two tunnels about a mile long each
13874, Yes
13875," Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!"
13876," Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth"
13877, N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
13878," Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version."
13879, Aspirationally
13880," 3 sea level optimized Raptors, 3 vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)"
13881," After the GoT finale, we dropped it to 6"
13882," Mk1 &amp; Mk2 ships at Boca &amp; Cape will fly with at least 3 engines, maybe all 6"
13883," About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer"
13884,Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
13885," The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers."
13886," But, essentially, the spinning things"
13887, Yes
13888," Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower."
13889,😉
13890, Did it for the memes
13891, Coming soon
13892," Yeah, been thinking about it for a long time. Electric supersonic VTOL. Hard problem."
13893, Hopefully in about 10 days
13894, Physics favors full flow
13895, Good design imo
13896, Thanks Sam!
13897, Good piece on lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles
13898, Sorry to hear that. Will fix.
13899, Ok
13900, Easy to turn one of our Starlink satellites into a debris collector
13901, Yes

13905, Nintendo won’t let us
13906," Maybe so eventually, but it will be information &amp; entertainment, not trickery"
13907,"Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead, we use that money to make the product great."
13908,We def need racing game using actual car steering wheel &amp; pedals!
13909, Of course
13910, Portal 1 &amp; 2 on this would rock
13911, Would be great to have &amp;!
13912,"Interact with games via touchscreen, steering wheel buttons &amp; XBox/PS controllers"
13913,Lots more games coming once we finish porting Unity!
13914, Top Secret
13915," It technically could, but wouldn’t have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable"
13916," No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of."
13918,"Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels"
13919, Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways.
13920,This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S &amp; X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters.
13921,😐
13922," Yeah, feels like something is messed up with Apple news app. Almost only ever shows negative news. Nickname is “the hate stream” 🤣"

13927, What makes resistance complex is that it’s half imaginary!
13928, Glad it worked out
13929, Congratulations &amp; on creating great open source literacy software!
13930,"6 more launches of 60 🛰 for initial activation, 12 for significant coverage"
13931,"Starlink mission will be heaviest payload ever at 18.5 tons. If all goes well, each launch of 60 satellites will generate more power than Space Station &amp; deliver 1 terabit of bandwidth to Earth."
13932, 🏴‍☠️
13933, That’s about right
13934, Probably start installing end of next month
13935," SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10."
13936," The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them."
13937, Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both.
13938, SpaceX is doing simultaneous competing builds of Starship in Boca Chica Texas &amp; Cape Canaveral Florida
13939," A lot, but you can’t count on lines"

14077," 21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can’t transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant."
14078," Exactly, Tesla &amp; Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net"
14079, We’re working on it. Takes time to get all regulatory approvals. Almost there for the larger US states. At least 6 to 12 months for Europe/UK.
14080, Certain regulatory agencies would beg to differ 🤣🤣
14081, 1
14082, Haha yes
14083," It’s just me writing, so the foolish things I say are entirely my fault 😜"
14084," Only see about 5% of mentions. No deep logic to those I answer. Aspirationally useful, but often whimsical."
14085," No, just preparing for untethered hover tests"
14086," Tom is still an advisor to SpaceX, but semi-retired about 5 years ago &amp; doesn’t work on Raptor. Will Heltsley heads propulsion overall, but Raptor is a team effort. No single leader."
14087, Great work by Tesla China team &amp; supporting contractors!
14088, Hoping to cover all of Eastern Europe this year
14089, Yup
14090, Everyone knows
14091, Cramer is a simulation. He’s not real.
14092, That’s odd. Will look into it.
14093, UK order page will go live around May 1 or 2
14094,We will delay $1k full self-driving option price increase until May 10 for those unable to order by May 1
14095,"UK Model 3 order page goes live next week, followed shortly thereafter by Japan, Australia, New Zealand &amp; Hong Kong"
14096,CleanTechnica summarizes new print cover story
14097, Haha
14098,"Will be sentient, of course"
14099, Range will be above 1000km
14100," Agreed, we’re ramping up service centers &amp; Tesla mobile service worldwide"
14101," More like $1000, but varies by country due to big differences in tax"
14102, Considering
14103,"As mentioned before, Tesla full self-driving option price will increase after May 1. You can order online at"
14104, Like blowing twigs too?
14105, Nope 😜
14106,Motor Trend on Model S updates
14107,Model S drives from San Francisco to Los Angeles without recharging
14108, Strange but true
14109,Can order online in 2 mins for home delivery &amp; return in 7 days for full refund
14110,New Model S has 370 mile / 595 km range
14111, Perhaps the Internet has some helpful suggestions?
14112, Can’t think of anything
14113, Someone else thought of an electric 🍁🍃🍂 blower first? What!?
14114,Tesla blows haha
14115, We can probably just repurpose Model 3 HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
14116, True
14117, Long lasting battery + fast recharge &gt; pack swap
14118, Haha ok
14119," It’s been suggested by many, externally &amp; internally"
14120, Maybe add a particulate filter on inlet
14121,"Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower"
14122," Yeah, there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed, Fred. Hello."
14123, Will do
14124, Absolutely
14125, Seriously
14126," Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez …"
14127," Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true."
14128," Thanks, support super appreciated"
14129, Sad if true 😔
14130,"When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious."
14131,"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
14132,"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
14133,"Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"
14134,Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never …
14135, Anti-matter def wins on energy density 🤣🤣
14136," Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
14137," As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed."
14138, Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone
14139, Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla
14140, Upgrading hardware is not important for a few months
14141, Is that a real billboard?
14142, We’ll let the NN loose on Track Mode one day … that’ll be insane
14143, Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark …
14144, Or maybe pegging
14145," On yeah, that too"
14146," Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."
14147,Full Self-Driving video
14148, All Model 3’s ever made can upgrade
14149,"Warning, this presentation is 4 hrs &amp; 20 mins long"
14150, Exactly
14151, All cars made since Oct 2016 either have the hardware needed for FSD or are trivially upgradeable
14152," Yeah, will post soon"
14153, It’s automatic
14154,Tesla Full Self-Driving

14203, Are you good with sheep?
14204, I’m an absolute unit too
14205," Yeah, gave everything I had to Tesla in Dec 2008"
14206," It’s not a big deal. Charge to 90% to 95% &amp; you’ll be fine. At 100% state of charge, regen braking doesn’t work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient."
14207, Haha
14208, Yes
14209, Rockets are not yet safe enough to fly over land
14210," Engines seem ok, pending inspection"
14211," It can, but the attachment fixtures are different from standard F9 &amp; they weren’t ready in time"
14212, Winter in snowfall is so beautiful
14213, I’m actually less crazy in person … or am I? 🤔
14214,I was always crazy on Twitter fyi
14215, Yes
14216, Haha true. I actually love horses.
14217,Buying a car in 2019 that can’t upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in 1919
14218, Love Just Water btw
14220," With steel membrane wings like a Dragon, we may be able to lower Starship’s orbital reentry temp to ~1000 degrees C, which would allow the whole surface to be uncooled bare metal"
14221, Starship will land on a ring of fire
14222, 6.5
14223, Yes
14224,Winter is coming
14225,Thinking about adding giant stainless steel dragon wings to Starship
14226," That tweet did take immense effort 🤣🤣 Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps."
14227, Deal
14228,Please support my campaign to rebrand as 🧦 emoji!

14230,"At some point, and I should just a get a room …"
14231, Just use this handy guide
14232, Yes
14233, Good interview by
14234, Truth
14235, Exactly
14236, How embarrassing. Will change.
14237, We will. You read it right.
14238, Haha true
14239, I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
14240," Good point, small oil is a problem too"
14241," I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …"
14242," Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
14243," True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
14244, Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil
14245, Starship is kinda Gundam
14246," Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply."
14247," Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner."
14248, Mint berry crunch
14249, poetic justice
14250, Boring candy coming soon …
14251," Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop."
14252," Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
14253," There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
14254, Yes
14255," Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
14256," Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
14257, Yes
14258," There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase"
14259," Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
14260, Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
14261, Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
14262, Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
14263, Something like that
14264,Starting May 1
14265,Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time
14266, Coming this year
14267,Lease a Tesla online in a few mins &amp; have it delivered to your house (return within 7 days for full refund)
14268, Cryptocurrency is my safe word
14269, Model 3 drive unit &amp; body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
14270, Cool
14271," On April 22, Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car"
14272, Da Vinci biography
14273, Malala
14274, That would be cool to do one day
14275, Other automakers change prices constantly &amp; substantially by varying rebates &amp; discounts according to negotiating strength of buyer. Tesla is transparent &amp; consistent.
14276," So if we raise prices in the future, will you cut Tesla a check? Can’t have it both ways."
14277, Ahem RHD
14278, LHD order page should be live within a few weeks. Deliveries start hopefully June/July.
14279, Coming this year
14280, Good point
14281,Leasing now available for Model 3

14290,The Falcons have landed
14291, .@SpaceX team would be so honored to fly this for!
14292, Haha exactly
14293, Upper atmospheric wind shear is very high. Will have to postpone launch unless weather improves soon.
14294, Vengeance
14295, Haha sure sounds like it
14296, Probably something notable to announce in a few months
14297," I hope a cybernetic interface is ready in time. Symbiosis, irrelevance  (hopefully blissful) or doom seem to be the three most likely paths."
14298, Actually true
14299, 😲
14300, Found a pic
14301," First flight for Falcon Heavy Block 5 means there is some risk of failure between 5% to 10% imo. Many good design improvements from Falcon Heavy demo, but the changes are unproven."
14302,I first read this as making wind with 🧀
14303, Norway has already proven it could be done last month. No question Australia could do this in far fewer than 11 years.
14304, .@JeffBezos copy 🐈
14305," No, it’s better"
14306," Building primary structure completion seems on track for May, but then it will take several months to install &amp; activate factory equipment"
14307, Love Brunel. Great first name too.
14308, Yes
14309, ~80%
14310, Mobile can do it no problem
14311, What city?
14312," Two, independent system-on-chip architecture, with each SoC having two NN accelerators that can perform simultaneous health-check calculations to protect against a soft error"
14313, Yes. Working through regulatory approvals.
14314, Time flies
14315, Any user input counts
14316, Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability &gt;&gt; human.
14317, It will enable video when parked &amp; connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.
14318, You’re welcome. Thanks for your great photos!
14319," Yeah, I’d love to do that"
14320,Starhopper
14321, Good idea
14322, Definitely
14323, Already fixed
14324, To make core AP more affordable
14325, That would be cool. Color variation causes havoc though.
14326,"Team is working on international versions super hard btw. Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules &amp; processes, so just takes time."
14327,Tesla Enhanced Summon coming out in US next week for anyone with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option
14328, Almost done
14329, Are you on Mad Max Mode? This may be too meek for places like the LA Freeway …
14330, Radar
14331, Sure
14332, Exactly
14333," Base AP will have same NN, so core functionality also improves"
14334, Many different regulatory authorities. Just takes time.
14335,Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.
14336,Starhopper just lifted off &amp; hit tether limits!
14337,Max thrust of 2550 tons will be almost 10% higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year
14338,"Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block 5, so we’re being extra cautious. Launch date might move."
14339, Exactly
14340,"“…drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for 34.8% of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.”"
14341, Hi Nina! So … how many £ would it take? Just between us.
14342,Stay positive 🧁
14343, Good point
14344, How much is it?
14345, 🤔
14346," I think I’ve paid for a subscription at least three times, but your paywall keeps forgetting this"
14347," Please fix your paywall. Your content is great, but your paywall is not."
14348, Yes
14349," Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars"
14350, That’s exactly the idea. What’s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.
14351, Thanks 😀
14352, Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.
14353, I’m told it’s looking positive &amp; we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
14354, Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
14355, Impressive analysis
14356," Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera."
14357," Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window."
14358," It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."
14359, Will take care of it
14360, Ok
14361, Improvements coming soon
14362," Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input."
14363, Great name 👍
14364, Neural net is upgraded too in this release. It’s not just a settings change.
14365," Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup."
14366,Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
14367, Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
14368,This is way more awesome than it might sound
14369, Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
14370, Agreed
14371, Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.
14372, Change your screen preference from night mode to auto
14373, Fur-curious
14374, These rumors are untrue!
14375," Responsible for more deaths than any other chemical! Weirdly, dihydrogen dixoxide, with only one extra oxygen, is not good to drink, but great for changing hair color."

14381, Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.
14382,Yup
14383, Some challenges with ice formation in the cryogenic propellant prevalves. Hopefully overcome soon.
14384, What could possibly go wrong?
14385, No
14386, You’re so right. Working on it!
14387, That car seemed so advanced when I watched that show as a kid! ♥️ Knight Industries Two Thousand

14425, C++ syntax sucks
14426," Assert (“Money” == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);"
14427, Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
14428, Like the movie Us. Scary … but also empathetic.
14429," No, but for sure the other way around!"
14430," Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest"
14431," We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey."
14432," Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare."
14433," Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible."
14434," Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
14435, Anyone who bought FSD will get it
14436,"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
14437, Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
14438," Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow."
14439," We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …"
14440, Super cool!
14441, Good point
14442," Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate."
14443," Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability."
14444, Exactly
14445, Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
14446," No, it is one week either way."
14447, 🤗
14448," I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo."
14449, It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!
14450," 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?"
14451,That’s exactly it. You’re no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. Makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day.
14452, Good point
14453,Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
14454," Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.

Yes, but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."
14455, Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.
14456,Thank you!
14457, Will do

14486, Coming soon
14487," Yes, full duration"
14488, White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin
14489," Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."
14490, Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.
14491, No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
14492,Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles
14493," Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots"
14494, Only some of the hottest sections
14495, Full size
14496, We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
14497," You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber."
14498," Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations."
14499, Agreed
14500," Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
14501," Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …"
14502," Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."
14503, First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
14504, Goes against interests of all Texans

14509, Yes!
14510," Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades aren’t so crazy"
14511," This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules."
14512," Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production"
14513," Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer"
14514," Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity."
14515," Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions."
14516," Still get this question a lot, even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice."

14544," In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday."
14545," However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
14546," We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board."
14547," When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."
14548, Yes

14558, True (sigh)
14559, True
14560," Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although they’re critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term."
14561," For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn’t have same safety criticality as crew."

14666," Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder."
14667," Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
14668," Yes, exciting potential"
14669, Exactly
14670," Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet."
14671, Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
14672," Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!"
14673," Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
14674," Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
14675," SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing … 🤗"

14682, Haha true
14683, It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
14684," Yes, lot of risk"
14685," Guys, I have feelings … 😜"
14686, Focusing on Starship instead
14687, Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific
14688," Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters."
14689," Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so"
14690," Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
14691," High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
14692, Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
14693, Yes 😀
14694,Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
14695, Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
14696," Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
14697, SN2 has changes that should help
14698, To the first part. I doubt we’d create a Dyson ring or sphere.
14699, Yes
14700," Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
14701," Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
14702, You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
14703, Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
14704," Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
14705," We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
14706," Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
14707," That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
14708," Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
14709, Don’t know
14710," SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years."
14711," Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
14712," SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
14713, So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌
14714, Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
14715," I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes."
14716,"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k."
14717, Won’t be long before they do

14756, The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
14757, At least 10X cheaper
14758," Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want."
14759, Yes
14760," This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
14761, Close
14762," But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
14763, Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
14764," Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
14765," Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
14766, I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
14767, About 11 secs
14768, Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
14769,"Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by engine/test team!"
14770, I was simply too sexy for it
14771, Maybe tomorrow
14772,"Just left Zeebrugge, now Tilburg, then Tesla HQ in Amsterdam &amp; Oslo tonight to review service in Norway. Exciting to see thousands of Model 3’s on their way to owners in Europe!"
14773, Hope they don’t find this pic!
14774,😅 thank goodness it’s not November
14775, a
14776,I want you too baby
14777,Joe Rogan describes Tesla for 4 mins &amp; 20 secs
14778," Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
14779," Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
14780," Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
14781, Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
14782," Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
14783," The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"
14784,🔥🖤 SpaceX Engineering 🖤🔥
14785, Telekinesis
14786, Vaporized some copper
14787, Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
14788,"Design requires at least 170 metric tons of force. Engine reached 172 mT &amp; 257 bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means 10% to 20% more with deep cryo."
14789,Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship &amp; Super Heavy
14790," Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
14792, We’re doing everything we can to get there. It’s a super hard grind.
14793," Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other &amp; lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, it’s way better."
14794, VAT of ~20% &amp; import duties of ~10% usually result in a 30% higher cost in Europe
14795,💙 Mach Diamonds 💙
14796, Glad you like it
14797, Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners &amp; main chamber
14798," Gaseous CH4/O2 &amp; heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a 💨 of insane power 😀"
14799," Will do, although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters."
14800, Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
14803,First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by team!!
14804, We will when it rolls out
14805, Yes
14806,At Texas with engineering team getting ready to fire new Raptor rocket engine
14807, soon
14808,Only a matter of time
14809, That might be the ultimate superpower
14810,How Model 3 performs on a long road trip 
14811," I’m openly moderate. There, I said it."
14812, Haha how is this even real?
14813," No, payload will actually increase"
14814, Exactly
14815, I do like nonsense memes. It’s true.
14816,Yes
14818, Next few days
14819,💩 looks like sentient choc ice cream
14820,Just bought oh yeah
14821, Whoa cool
14822, No plans to do so. Would recommend Model S.
14823, 7
14824, ♥️ logarithms
14825, Dammit! 😀
14826," We’ll tweak the alloy over time, so it won’t exactly be 301, but close"
14827," Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
14828," Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn’t even need paint!"
14829, Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
14830, Mostly true
14831," Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
14832, Yes
14833,Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
14834,Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at Texas
14835, Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
14836," To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding"
14837," Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack"
14838, Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
14839, And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
14840," About 10 orbit synch windows, which are every 26 months, so self-sufficiency around 2050"
14841,All our patent are belong to you
14842,"Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day"
14843,Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp; it’s happening!
14844, Tasty food!
14845, It’s designed for 100 people on a Mars journey
14846," Sure, which ones?"
14847, You’re most welcome! Very thoughtful questions.
14848, Max Tegmark is great
14849,Entropy is the source and the end of life in this instance of the Multiverse
14850, 3 guys standing on roof of skyscraper. 1st guy says updraft is so strong it blows you back on roof of you jump off. He jumps off &amp; is blown back on roof. 2nd guy tries &amp; goes splat. 3rd guy: that was a dirty trick Superman.
14851,"If heat death will be inevitable end of Universe, it actually *is* all about journey 🤔"
14852,Entropy is the ultimate boss battle
14853, Haha
14854,tbh smh
14855, Haha true
14856,SpaceX documentary actual footage
14857, Sure hope that happens
14858,"Great electric car documentary about early days of Tesla, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf &amp; Gadget. So much has happened since then …"
14859, We are so tiny
14860," You drive a hard bargain, but … ok"
14861, $5
14862,Host meme review?
14863," It’s an honor, sir! Thanks for owning a Tesla."
14864,Tap Tesla logo at top of your car’s touchscreen &amp; wait 10 secs to open special features box
14865,Still my favorite tweet of all time
14866," Ok, we’ll throw that in too"
14867,"But, occasionally, the metal version"
14868, Haha
14869,Tesla Sentry Mode will play Bach’s Toccata and Fugue during a robbery (and keep Summer safe)
14870," All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary &amp; backup power to doors, brakes, steering &amp; airbags."
14871, Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by.
14872," Yeah, worked on my cousin’s farm for six weeks around my 18th birthday. I was so kewl."
14873, Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
14874, So tempting …
14875, It’s like looking in a mirror!
14876, That would be so cool!
14877," Yes, and my grandfather was from Minnesota with some Scandinavian/German background. Got to hand it to Norway. That’s a great sculpture!"
14878,Awesome moose sculpture! ♥️🇳🇴
14879, Rough beta in 2 to 3 weeks
14880, Feature has now been in place for 8 months
14881, These are industrial strength. Not recommended for use at home!
14882,Testing metallic heat shield at 1100C (2000F)
14884," Sure. Also, we need to be better at remembering brightness settings."
14885, 💡😀
14886, The youth love em
14887,"If test flight of 🐉 goes well next month, 👨‍🚀 👩‍🚀 will 🚀 to this summer!"
14888, Actual tanks are fine
14889," ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel."
14890," 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp"
14891, Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
14892," Since it’s part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it"
14893,Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
14894," Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels."
14895, Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
14896," When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water"
14897, untrue
14898, Roughly 4 to 20 minutes for light to travel from Earth to Mars
14899, Director of CERN asked me about Boring Co building the new LHC tunnel when we were at the. Would probably save several billon Euros.
14900, Yes

14903, Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing
14904," I wish them well. Track record in auto startups is tough. Thousands of US auto startups, but only Ford &amp; Tesla have avoided bankruptcy. A similar scenario is likely in all countries."
14905, Wow
14906, Yup
14907," Thanks, good idea!"
14908," Yes, ending on Feb 1. It’s adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model 3."
14909, Order must occur before Feb 1
14910," No, the whole referral incentive system will end"
14911,"The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb 1. If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla &amp; give them 6 months of free Supercharging, please do so before then."
14912, I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
14913," Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it’s not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings"
14914, How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
14915," Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX"
14916," The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication"
14917," The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport."
14918, Haha you’re welcome! Hope you’re doing well.
14919," About $15M/km for a two way high speed transit, so probably around $750M plus maybe $50M/station"
14920,Glad you like it
14921, Yes
14922,LA is so beautiful after the rain
14923,SpaceX Dragon from as seen from viewport
14924, We are not yet offering the mid range Model 3 in Europe
14925," Which country? There is a 10% import duty, ~20% VAT (US prices don’t include sales tax) and about $2000 in extra shipping cost, but it shouldn’t add up to $25k."
14926,View of SpaceX Dragon 1 berthed with in the last Cupola opening. Dragon 2 (Crew Dragon) launching soon.
14927, Ok
14928,Obv must be more pointy tho
14929,It needed to be made real
14930, Haha
14932,Starship Hopper will do vertical flight tests similar to the Falcon 9 Hopper
14933, Body/tank diameter is 9m or about 30ft
14934, Yes
14935, Yes
14936, Yes
14937,"This is for suborbital VTOL tests. Orbital version is taller, has thicker skins (won’t wrinkle) &amp; a smoothly curving nose section."
14938,"Starship test flight rocket just finished assembly at the Texas launch site. This is an actual picture, not a rendering."
14939, Yes
14940, Getting some regulatory pushback. May not be available in all regions.
14941, Going through final validation &amp; regulatory approval. Probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. It’s trippy!
14942, Yes 🚀
14943,Tesla *with* Autopilot engaged is twice as safe &amp; continues to make steady improvements
14944, Def not
14945, Yes
14946,"Starting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the 75 kWh version of the Model S &amp; X. If you’d like that version, please order by Sunday night at"
14947, Good idea
14948, It’s an option
14949, Vertically or horizontally?
14950, No problem
14951," Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance"
14952, I don’t think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
14953, I’m not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats.
14954, It will be
14955,"Btw, you can buy a Tesla online in less than 2 mins &amp; give it back for a full refund for any reason"

14963," Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China, not North America. Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers."
14964,Shanghai Giga production of Model 3/Y will serve greater China region
14965,"Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model 3 production end of year &amp; reach high volume production next year"
14966,Looking forward to breaking ground on the Shanghai Gigafactory today!
14967,Good sign that almost no Model 3 owners want to sell their cars!

15036,"Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
15037, We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
15038, Ok
15039, Wow!
15040," This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
15041,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
15042,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."

15061, Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
15062,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
15063,Engineering is true magic
15064, Yezzz

15070, Thanks!
15071," It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
15072," You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo."
15073," Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level."
15074, Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
15075," Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
15076," Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” 😀"
15077," Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars."
15078, Coldformed at cryo
15079," This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter."
15080, Exactly

15082, Yes
15083," I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
15084," While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
15085," Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
15086," If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
15087," It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end"
15088, Try connecting to WiFi
15089,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.

15111, Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
15112,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
15113, Exactly
15114," The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
15115," Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
15116," Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
15117," Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
15118," You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
15119," Pop up, park and walk!"
15120, I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
15121,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
15122,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
15123,Next step for Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
15124, Precisely
15125,Presentation starting at 8:15
15126," This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
15127,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
15128," Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better."
15129,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
15130,"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
15131, Yes
15132,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
15133,Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
15134,Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight
15135, Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
15136, Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP
15137, Exactly. It’s a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
15138," Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!"
15139,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
15140, Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel’s Founder’s Fund: “we have no concerns whatsoever.”
15141," Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
15142, ‘Tis
15143,Medieval Futurism
15144,Tesla 💨 app almost done. Important to get every note right!
15145, Thanks!
15146, The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats &amp; just wipe it off.
15147, Congratulations!
15148, You got it
15149, Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build &amp; interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
15150, 👍
15151, Zero Suit 😉
15152, God Fire
15153,💕🍜 ramen is sooo good🍜 💕
15154, Exactly 😀
15155, This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound.
15156, You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
15157, Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
15158," Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”."
15159, About 10 to 14 days
15160,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
15161,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. 

To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
15162, No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
15163, I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
15164,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. 

Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
15165, Probably next month
15166, You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story.
15167," We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
15168, Probably end of next year
15169, So true 🦙💩✨😴
15170, This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
15171, We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
15172," Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability."
15173,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
15174,"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps."
15175, Machete!!
15176," It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
15177,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."
15178," Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China."
15179," Buying took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like even when we were only making 🚘."
15180,"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
15181, But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
15182, Yes
15183, Interesting
15184," Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
15185, The new design is metal
15186," As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
15187,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
15188,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
15189,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
15190," Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
15191, We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
15192," Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
15193,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
15194,Falcon/Dragon launch to in 9 minutes
15195, Us too sigh
15196,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
15197,64 satellites 🛰 on this flight!
15198," We’re adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
15199," Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
15200, It is so hard to move in armor!
15201, You’re all hired!
15202, Yes … no … maybe …
15203,None shall pass!
15204, Ok
15205, Good advice
15206, Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
15207, Glad you’re ok
15208," Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
15209," As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
15210," Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
15211, You got it!
15212," Three things, one of which is CH4"
15213, No
15214, No
15215," Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Can’t wipe it off."
15216, Haha
15217," Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience."
15218," Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC."
15219, True ♥️
15220,♥️♥️♥️♥️🛸🛸🛸🛸♥️♥️♥️♥️
15221, Both
15222, Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
15223, One day
15224," We’re doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we’re just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
15225, Update soon
15226, Sorry ☺️
15227,Boring breakthrough
15228, Definitely
15229,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
15230, We tried. Nintendo won’t license it to us.
15231, That would be cool
15232, Haha kinda true 😀
15233, Never heard of it
15234,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games."
15235, Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
15236, Yes
15237," This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
15238,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
15239, Tiny wizard 🧙‍♂️
15240, 7 to 10 years
15241," Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
15242, Touché
15243,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work"
15244," Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80."
15245,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week"
15246,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then,, &amp; are the places to be."
15247, Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
15248, 😉😉
15249, 1000 liters of pure water costs $1
15250,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
15251, Ah yes fair point
15252,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
15253, Not yet
15254,🖤 trouble
15255,Earth is
15256," Earth’s crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
15257," Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it’s all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land."
15258," Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
15259," Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield"
15260,"If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America via"
15261,Signing off for a while
15262,Happy Thanksgiving!!
15263,🚀 Starships were meant to fly 🚀
15264, Starship Tooters
15265, Good one
15266, Good idea
15267, Coming soon
15268, Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
15269, Should be next week
15270," No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9"
15271, Later versions will
15272,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
15273,Renaming BFR to Starship
15274," No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
15275, Yes
15276,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
15277,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
15278," No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
15279," In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
15280," What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
15281," Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
15282, Ok
15283, Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
15284, Investigating
15285, Probably mid 2019
15286, Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
15287," Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
15288, Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
15289," No, but perhaps in a few years"
15290," Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
15291," Haha, just like Super Troopers"
15292, Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
15293,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
15294," Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
15295, Radical change
15296,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
15297, It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
15298,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
15299,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
15301,Boring Company just broke through the other side!! 
15302, Missed miku concert sigh
15303,Listening to Better Now
15304," China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp; transport"
15305,"Sure hope this isn’t true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
15306, Haha 😀
15307,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon 9 🚀 landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
15308,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for 3 min bulk discount.
15309, While (!castle) {brick++};
15310, Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
15311,Fortnite irl
15312,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
15313,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
15314,Not much but it is ours
15315,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
15316," We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains don’t leave often."
15317," Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
15318, Yes
15319,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
15320, We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
15321, Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
15322,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
15323,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30
15324, We will fight Big Tequila!
15325, That would be awesome
15326, Easily accessible energy
15327, Send me a note!
15328, Would be fun to add to Tesla
15329, Yes
15330, Will try again next month
15331,"Congratulations team! Thanks, much appreciated."
15332, Is he ok?
15333,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
15334, Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
15335," Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
15336,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
15337," That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
15338,"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …"
15339, Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
15340," Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
15341,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
15342," Fair point, will reenable"
15343," Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
15344,Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
15345, Cool
15346," With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
15347, Yes
15348, Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
15349," No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
15350, Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
15351, Aiming for orbital flight by June
15352,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
15353,But comments are 👌
15354, LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec 10. Runs parallel to 105 freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to 405.
15355,"I think Twitter is deleting fake, scam or maybe even inactive accounts. My follower count decreased by ~20k over the past few days."
15357," Sure, we can do it"

15363,Love Oumuamua jokes
15364,Remember the future
15365,Oh hi guys … lol
15366," Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
15367," Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating"
15369,So underappreciated
15370, Ok
15371, Ok
15372,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
15373, What is love?
15374, Bikini Bottom
15375, Fair
15376," Yes, that is how"
15377,We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
15378, Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
15379, Wow that’s cool!
15380,Kids these days have it easy
15381,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
15382, Haha
15383,First movie I ever saw in theaters
15384,When the only existing life was a sponge
15385,Although it was in the precambrian era
15386,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
15387, They’re great! Honored to work with them.
15388, Definitely
15389," Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
15390," Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020"
15391," Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
15392," To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
15393," Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
15394," Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
15395, Prob 2 to 3 weeks
15396, v true
15397, cute
15398, Haha
15399,Bring Me the Horizon
15400, Aiming for next week
15401, ♥️ Norway 🇳🇴
15402," #’s r wrong, but 🐻 in 🧠 Tesla makes 🚘s 4 overseas &amp; East Coast in 1st half of quarter"
15403," Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
15405, We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
15406, Hahaha &lt;ahem&gt;
15407, Um yes
15408," Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon &amp; say who’s the pet now …"
15409,"Also, you’ll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
15410,Car will drive to your phone location &amp; follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
15411,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
15412,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
15413," For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid &amp; park."
15414, Cool haha
15415,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer &amp; secretary. Guess I have to keep 1st one or it will confuse the authorities."
15416," Good point, might put that one back"
15417,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. I’m now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
15418, Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
15419," Don’t worry, we’ll make it right"
15420, The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
15421, Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
15422," It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …"
15423," Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?"
15424, We will enable track mode for all performance cars
15425," Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
15426," Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
15427, Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
15428, Exactly. That’s Monday.
15429," Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
15430," No, but I will"
15431, Isn’t it obvious?
15432, Worth it
15433, True
15434,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
15435," Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
15436, Haha
15437," On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%."
15438," Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
15439," Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit"
15440, Exactly
15441, You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
15442,"On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great."
15443,Glad you’re ok 
15444," S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model 3, so bikes can fit in trunk"
15445, Hey that’s my Halloween costume!
15446, Good question
15447," Clearly, you’re not reading my twitter"
15448, I wish
15449, Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
15450, Yes Zorbix
15451," Sir, I would never …"
15452," Yes, I am a little girl. Ok, not that little. Or a girl."
15453,Making progress …
15454,I said dankest not darkest omg
15455, im actually cat girl here’s selfie rn
15456, It’s pretty hot

15470,Send me ur dankest memes!!
15471,🐻 in 🧠
15472,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
15473," Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone."
15474,Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.
15475, Same
15476, 2025
15477,How’d they know!?
15478, Around mid 2019
15479," There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
15480, Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
15481,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
15482,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
15483," Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
15484, Working on it
15485, That is correct
15486,Twitter thought I got hacked &amp; locked my account haha
15487, Wanna buy some Bitcoin? 😉😉
15488,And I own a chibi Wolverine
15490,i🖤anime
15491,"Order Tesla without test drive &amp; you get 3 days to return for refund, else 1 day"
15492, Former
15493, Will be in next point release
15494," Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country."
15495, Good point …
15496, Interesting
15497," This is a ~ 6000 ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."
15498, Under LA (Hawthorne)
15499, 155 mph | 250 km/h
15500," Pretty close, actually"
15501, I think real
15502,Opens Dec 10
15503,The first tunnel is almost done
15504, N00B!
15505,Twitter is Dark Souls of social media. Reddit is Bloodborne. Insta is Zelda.
15506, Good idea!
15507," This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff"
15508, Coming soon
15509, Turn on enhanced security via the settings page. This will require entering a passcode to use the car.
15510, ♥️
15511, Digital Style!
15512, Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time?
15513, BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. It’s time people knew.
15514," No, bored me, I will not"
15515, Maybe phone as controller
15516, Exactly
15517, Coming
15518, Yes
15519, Reality is hard
15520, Online doesn’t count
15521, Coming soon
15522, No
15523, That’s next
15524,Had to been done ur welcome
15525, I hope this is true!
15526," If you don’t like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
15527,"Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
15528," It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
15529,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."
15530," It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
15531,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 &amp; super simple new order page"
15532, Week or two
15533,Love the Reddit comments too
15534,Dog saves her puppies
15535, y
15536,You’ll see
15537,Tomorrow brings a lemur
15538,Special Circumstances
15539, Yes 😀
15540, New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
15541," Yes, aiming for next few months"
15542," True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
15543,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
15544,Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
15545,Insightful article by David
15546," Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you’re one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
15547, The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
15548, I believe it’s $5k
15549, ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
15550, Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
15551," To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
15552," This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
15553, Still a long way to go
15554,Model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
15555,Works best if you play games full screen &amp; use steering wheel scroller balls for control
15556, Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now 😀
15557,🖤🖤🖤🖤  🚘🚘🚘🚘  🖤🖤🖤🖤
15558, What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
15559, Yes
15560," Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! 45,000 people now."
15561,It is time to create a mecha
15562, NERV
15563, &lt;ahem&gt; Elon-chan
15564, Great. Also love Princess Mononoke.
15565,Love Your Name
15566, Maybe this could be part of a (safe) car version of Pokémon Go style game
15567, Towelie 💗
15568, Good idea!
15569, Whole beer keg fits in Model 3 trunk!
15570," Wow, mechanical logic gates"
15571, Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
15572, Maybe wise to bring it just in case 👽👾 😉
15573, About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves
15574, Yes
15575,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."
15576,Visual approximation
15577,Teslaquila coming soon …
15578, Beautiful picture
15579," Yes, it’s hard to find. Not sure why."
15580," Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSA’s *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
15581, This is incorrect
15582,At Falcon LZ-1 Vandenberg on Sunday night with the Base Commander. Support of much appreciated.
15583,Studebaker Museum in South Bend
15584, Punctuality is not my strong suit
15585, We’d be nothing without our fans
15586, Because 11 is obviously louder than 10 😀
15587, No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
15588, It sure does. Very reliable.
15589, You are right
15590,A reminder of why it’s important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power
15591," You’re most welcome, glad I could be helpful! Thanks for letting me know about it."
15592, Warms my ❤️ 😀
15593,"The physics of how Tesla achieved best safety of any cars ever tested. Note, when vehicle weight is taken into account, order is more like X,S, then 3, but they are all very close."
15595,(Credit)
15596,Falcon has landed
15597,"Tesla owner shows how well ultrawhite seats hold up after 25,000 miles. The black &amp; white interior is def best imo."
15598, My fav character
15599,Sonic boom warning. This won’t be subtle.
15600, Two — one for 👽 👾 millions of years from now and one for you
15601," Yes, but 🐻 in 🧠 that we’re creating a generalized autonomy solution. Must work in millions of strange 🚘 situations."
15602,Blade Runner — Esper Edition — Vangelis
15603," Actually, it’s 1 of 3 forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked."
15604, Fair point 😀
15605," When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
15606," Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
15607, V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
15608, Only if they’re extremely tiny
15609,Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years
15610, Rococo Basilisk is
15611,First Falcon 9 land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!
15612, The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
15613," The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
15614," Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
15615," Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
15616," There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
15617, I hope to be less wrong over time
15618, You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
15619,What they do should be illegal
15620,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
15621, Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
15622,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
15623, This is amazing
15624, Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to 1000 more users a few days ago.
15625,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
15626," If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
15627, True
15628, Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It’s what they do.
15629,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
15630,Great verdict 😀
15631, Could be worse 😇
15632,Naughty by Nature 😉
15633, Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
15634, Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
15635,That was intense
15636, !! Will take action.
15637,And remember …
15638,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
15639,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
15640, Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
15641, You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay!
15642, What would be great is original Elite
15643, Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
15644,♥️ Tesla Owners ♥️
15645," Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
15646, 😀
15647," Apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
15648, Tricky one
15649," Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
15650, Probably 2028 for a base to be built
15651,Mars Base Alpha
15653," Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
15654," Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
15655, Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at
15656," Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
15657, A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
15658," Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
15659," Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
15660,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
15661," Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
15662, Haha true
15663,.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
15664, 👽💘
15665," Wow, glad they’re ok!"
15666, Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
15667,♥️
15668, Tesla Rangers!
15669," 31 engines, but with room to add 11 more down the road. Kinda have to."
15670," Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldn’t spend computing power on sound"
15671, Yes
15672,True 😀
15673," To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
15674, You’re most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
15675, Will do. Love Reddit.
15676, Space Bar
15677," Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions &amp; anyone will be able to go"
15678," Yeah, Starlink should be active by then"
15679, Sorry! So many bots!!
15680,"Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so it’ll feel like you’re there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light"
15681, Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. There will be no obligation to do so.
15682, Very close
15683, 😀
15684, Always
15685, Yes
15686, That’s the first BFR airframe/tank barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material
15687," Yeah … that’s exactly how I feel. However it happens, I just hope it does."
15688, Thanks for helping fund a rocket &amp; spaceship that could take humanity beyond Earth!
15689,Hanging out with before the moon mission announcement
15690,Yusaku will be bringing 8 (brave) artists &amp; cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon!
15691, Probably V10 alpha build
15692," Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
15693, Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
15694, Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
15695, Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It’s not sustainable long-term.
15696, Very interesting
15697,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"
15698, This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
15699," Yes, I do"
15700,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting crewed spaceflight and National Security missions
15701,"Btw, can’t emphasize enough how would not be where it is today without. Thank you."
15702, With lasers
15703, My fav tweet ever
15704," if you can help get rid of the annoying scam spammers, that would be much appreciated"
15705, Ok

15713," Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We’re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly."
15714, Awesome 😎
15715," Design has been changed so the 🚀 lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)"
15716," Sorry, it’s not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesn’t incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
15717, Yes
15718," Yeah, that’s our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
15719,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
15720,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
15721,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"
15722, True
15723,Tesla owners can grant free Supercharging for life to a friend who buys S/3/X. Ends tomorrow night.
15724, Hi Dustin!
15725," The Tesla board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in 100+ years, despite many setbacks. Tesla owes its very existence to this board!"

15736,.@boringcompany will transport your car all the way into your garage
15737, Thoughtful feedback
15738,"Due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America, Tesla customers may experience longer response times. Resolving this is our top priority."
15739," My apologies, am working on this exact issue right now"
15740, Best show in the multiverse!
15741," No, service will stock all colors"
15742," Love that red. We tried every possible way to make red look 3D without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. We have to stop whole paint shop for red &amp; it looks like an episode of Dexter."
15743,"Moving 2 of 7 Tesla colors off menu on Wednesday to simplify manufacturing. Obsidian Black &amp; Metallic Silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price."

15757," Am running it in my car, but it’s not right yet. Hopefully, will release to advanced early access users in a week or two, then more broadly towards end of month."
15758," Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements."
15759," The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity"
15760," Sorry, we’ve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. If need be, we’re repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done."
15761, Can Steve Bannon please insult me some more? Best PR I’ve had in a while.

15763, I was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned
15764, V cool
15765, So you actually did nothing &amp; yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is.
15766," Answer the question. You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?"
15767," At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam"
15768, Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?
15769," It’s coming, I swear"
15770, You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services. And you call yourself …
15771, Great actions by Twitter to delete bogus accounts. Will increase usage by real users.
15772," For the record, my voice cracked once during the NY Times article. That’s it. There were no tears."

15775,"The world lost a great man in John McCain. He was an honorable, kind, brave and fundamentally decent human being. If only there were more such people in the world."
15776, This is why a small company with tight focus &amp; high energy can beat a big company without
15777, This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
15778," Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs."
15779," Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …"
15780, Maybe …
15781," This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors."
15782," The extension cord was 1000 miles long, but still"
15783," What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord"
15784," In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public."
15785, It’s almost done
15786," Yes 😀🖤🚀, looks brutal otherwise"
15787,This is actually real
15788,"This time, the vacuum tunnel will be a bit longer &amp; SpaceX will provide some advance funding for student teams with most promising designs. Bonus award for all race pods that exceed half the speed of sound!"
15789," Tesla Car Karaoke hopefully ready in OTA software update version 10. Just played Missile Command, Asteroids &amp; Lunar Lander in V9. Really fun!"
15790, I was just there. Cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught fire. Super appreciate fast response by Fremont fire dept! No injuries or damage to factory.
15791,"Goal is to service your car wherever you are, quietly &amp; quickly. No need to bring it to a Tesla service center."
15792, Ok
15793,"Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought.

15797, Thank you for the thoughtful letter
15798," Thanks for buying our car! Would highly recommend performance version. It’s really good &amp; I don’t say that lightly. Nothing will give you greater joy. Full refund, no hard feelings if not."

15823,Great Q&amp;A last night. Thanks for helping make Tesla &amp; SpaceX more secure! Planning to open-source Tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. Extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all.
15824," Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun  project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new &amp; delightful to see."
15825," Production design will be better, especially in details. We are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of Model 3 &amp; bringing Y to market"

15838, Those are the new design made of titanium. Doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
15839," Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware"
15840, Yes
15841, Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot.
15842,Tesla deliveries &amp; AP hardware chart by at MIT
15843, Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
15844," Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
15845, No change
15846,Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private
15847, Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
15848, Yes
15849, I don’t have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.
15850,Good morning 😀
15851, 420
15852,Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.

15861, Much more interesting
15862," Games &amp; other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X &amp; 3 from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model 3’s plus S &amp; X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher)."
15863,Glad you’re enjoying Model 3 &amp; thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot &amp; fun games coming in a month with V9.0.
15864, Yup

15932, Great!
15933, We’ve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. It’s like hitting a square wave.
15934," We’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be “tap here &amp; you get your car”. Then, if you don’t like it for any reason, just return it like any other product."
15935, Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
15936," Wow, that’s really awesome. Thank you! ♥️@TeslaOwnersUK"
15937, Haha
15938, Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.
15939,Wall Street
15940, Congratulations to all teams in the student competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
15941," Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap “maintain” &amp; your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked."
15942," Yes, Tesla Model S, X &amp; 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked"
15943, Ok

15947, It is much better
15948, Sorry 🤗
15950,🦄💨✌️
15951, I love that scene
15952, I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
15953, Don’t make me bite my thumb at you
15954, For sure
15955," Btw, 1792 is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
15956," Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds."
15957,No kidding
15958," Yes, that will probably be its first use"
15959," Phew 😅. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
15960, I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
15961," Figuratively, literally or both?"
15962," This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. “Other US” refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
15963," Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders."
15964, Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
15965," Wow, someone has really thought about this!"
15966,I wish
15967," As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader."
15968, Good point
15969, I have never donated to a SuperPAC
15970," Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
15971,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
15972,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
15973," That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
15974, So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
15975," Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone."
15976, Actually true

16001,Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China. Very thoughtful about the long-term future.
16002, Would love to. It’s been too long.
16003, Prob early next year
16004,Just finished an amazing 3 day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy &amp; vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team &amp; potential for the future.
16005, Sure 🌌 💫
16006," Look, at least it’s not the Magellanic Clouds. They’re basically next door."
16007,"Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. It’s amazing."
16008,So true
16009, The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
16010, Sounds good
16011, Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
16012, It will happen for sure. Damn.
16013, Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
16014," Damn, now I want donuts 🍩"
16015, Yeah
16016, Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
16017," You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
16018, Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
16019," For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow."
16020, Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
16021, Great move
16022, Why sir … 😊
16023,Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome
16024, Good point
16025," Definitely. Can’t wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
16026," Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
16027,Well … it looked smaller on paper
16028,"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
16029," Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
16030, It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
16031, Makes a lot of sense
16032, This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
16033, Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
16034, Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
16035, Please lmk results of your water tests
16036," When you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
16037, Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
16038, Exactly
16039," No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
16040, Already have
16041," Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
16042," Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time."
16043," Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
16044," Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time."
16045," The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
16046,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
16047,Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
16048, That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
16049, A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
16050, Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
16051," According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
16052,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
16053," Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
16054," According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
16055, Tube diameter is 31cm
16056," Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
16057,Thanks for letting us use your pool
16058, It is an honor to work with them
16059,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
16061, I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
16062, It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
16063," Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
16064," Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player."
16065," Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
16066, 
16067, Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
16068," Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand"
16069," Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure."

16079," Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
16080,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
16081, Yes
16082, Yes
16083, Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
16084, Yes
16085," 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
16086, I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
16087," Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
16088,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
16089,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
16090, Ground winds would
16091, Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
16092, Can’t be too buoyant
16093,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
16094, Good idea
16095," Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
16096, You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
16097," Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
16098, Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
16099, It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
16100," Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
16101, I would def recommend this
16102, Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
16103, Interesting
16104," Great, thanks"
16105, Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
16106," So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in"
16107," Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
16108, SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
16109," Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
16110, Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
16111," Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
16112, Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
16113," I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
16114, I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
16115, They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
16116, Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
16117, Why did publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
16118, 
16119, .@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective
16120," Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
16121, Are you 100% certain that stands by &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
16122, Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
16123," So publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
16124," .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
16125, What a coincidence …
16126, Am not attacking all media or even all of. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
16127," Indeed, very simple question. To be specific:, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
16128," Exactly., I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
16129," Strange., is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
16130,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
16131," Sounds very sketchy if true., is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
16132," Wow, so of wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work &amp;."
16133," .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
16134," .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

16213, Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.
16214, Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
16215, True
16216," We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate"
16217," “… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”"
16218," “All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”"

16353," Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
16354, More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
16355, How big is your short position? Just curious.
16356," I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
16357," UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
16358," I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."
16359," I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
16360," Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
16361," Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case."
16363," SX 300 &amp; soon SX 500. Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine."
16364," Structures, engines, avionics, guidance &amp; control software, new alloys, space lasers (ooh, maybe I shouldn’t have said that) …"
16365, Love you too 💕
16366, 👽🧚‍♀️🚀🍃🍄🍕🍕🍕
16367, Fair point
16368,"Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldn’t resist)"
16369, And I don’t trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.
16370, Your math isn’t very good. Would require 61%. And what’s your issue anyway? Better suggestions are welcome.

16372, I dare you to stop following me. Do it.
16373, Ok
16374,The enemy of my enemy is myself
16375, Exactly
16376, Libertinarian
16377," Direct democracy by the people. Laws must be short, as there is trickery in length. Automatic expiration of rules to prevent death by bureaucracy. Any rule can be removed by 40% of people to overcome inertia. Freedom."
16378, The mind sacrificing itself in the final ship battle
16379," All of them, especially Surface Detail"
16380,"If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks"
16381, I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies
16382," If I’m not a communist, why do I make red cars 🚘 🤔"
16383," Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."
16384, That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
16385, lol
16386," Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good."
16387, Might actually be his!
16388,Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in 3 weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of 1st Model 3 dual motor performance coming off the line …
16389, You’re a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
16390, Yes
16391, Sigh
16392,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
16393,"“No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief!
How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 
Answer: That’s not funny!!"

16396,"Heading back into the factory, so that’s enough for now. Don’t take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, it’s called a “Tweet”."
16397, No
16398, My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
16399," There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation."
16400,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
16401, Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
16402, Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.
16403, A socialist
16404,"Those who proclaim themselves “socialists” are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp; attended an expensive college. Fate loves irony."
16405, What is yours?
16406, What is your utopia?
16407, The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape &amp; size of those streams.
16408," Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time."
16409, I always wanted to do a terms &amp; conditions cover of Green Eggs &amp; Ham
16410, Foundation Series &amp; Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX
16411, I love Banks. Best books in recent years imo are Iain Banks &amp; George Martin.
16412," Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
16413,Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. It’s pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by Douglas Adams &amp; Isaac Asimov.
16414, My donations are anonymous
16415, Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is steady state.
16416,"My “pay” is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on Earth w my foundation. Just don’t want us to be sad about the future."
16417, Dankonia
16418, We use less than 3% cobalt in our batteries &amp; will use none in next gen
16419," Yes, interface will change with Version 9 software"
16420," Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean “slight up or downward force on the wheel”, not really “hold the wheel”"
16421," Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly."
16422,"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered:"
16423, That is actual footage
16424, Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
16425, Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
16426," Of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we’re never going to make them again."
16427," Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
16428," Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof."
16429, Not recommended for urban environments
16430, Yes
16431," The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
16432, It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
16433, Love this design. Simpler the better.
16434, Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
16435," Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
16436, A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
16437," Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
16438, Will do
16439," Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
16440," You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another."
16441," Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
16442," Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
16443," That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
16444,"This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔"
16445,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
16446, 20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
16447," In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
16448," That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
16449,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps."
16450,"More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)"
16451," We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
16452," Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
16453,"19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…"
16454,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …"
16455,"Terms &amp; conditions for “Not-a-Flamethrower”

Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book “Green Eggs and Ham”. 

#ThrowFlamesResponsibly"
16456,"Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: “Not a Flamethrower”."
16457, Yes
16458," Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher. 

Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter."
16459,"Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs."
16460, Coming soon
16461, I think so :)
16462,Nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a TBC Flamethrower
16463,First 1000 Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today!
16464, We’re building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
16465, Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
16466, Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
16467," Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter"
16468,And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
16469," Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form …"
16470,Running track in BF Spaceship will look something like this
16471," No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model 3 cars."
16472, Working on improving
16473," No way 6 mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, 7 mins is obv right."
16474," Oh please, that’s obv overkill"
16475,Tip of the day …
16476, Coming soon
16477," We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years."
16478, Congratulations. Good move by. Please use Matt’s Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor
16479," Yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of 4"
16480,"Am def not under any illusion that this will end illiteracy, but I hope it helps at least a little"
16481," Good morning, Sonic. Not sure how to break it to you, but …"
16482," We have about 11,000 projects underway in Puerto Rico"
16483, Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
16484, You should get an invite to configure in next few days
16485, Definitely
16486," Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
16487, Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.
16488, Next year
16489, Twitter is so dark …
16490, No … no …
16491, That is horrifying

16494, The future
16495, Exactly!
16496, I was an alien 🛸👽♥️💫
16497, Actually true!
16498," Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
16499," But don’t worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything’s just fine"
16500," Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
16501, The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
16502,Glad you’re ok!
16503,Some details on the Tesla air filtration system
16504, Mid 2019 for RHD
16505, That sounds like a fun adventure!
16506, You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
16507," Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little 🥜 on S/X."
16508,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind"
16509," Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3."
16510,"Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus"

16519, Hi! 💕👻😅
16520, Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
16521,Hell of a week
16522, Just for perspective
16523," True, no one is perfect"
16524, You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
16525," Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism."
16526," Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
16527, Prob 8.3
16528, Yes
16529,"All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say “bug report” followed by issue description."
16530, “Pneumatic” means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
16531," Yeah, absolutely"
16532,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from. Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
16533,Like you guys too 🚘 🖤
16534," Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
16535," Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
16536, Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
16537, Peace ✌️

16540,"At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all."
16541," You’re saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a “good person”?"
16542, This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!
16543," “Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
16544," Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
16545," Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up."
16546," You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
16547, Great book. Read it when it came out.
16548, Exactly
16549, SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. That’s 7 better than 51.
16550, Yeah
16551, Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
16552, Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
16553, Yes
16554, You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
16555," Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money."
16556, I really want to make this cupholder
16557, I’ve literally had dreams about cup holder designs
16558, Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
16559, You’re welcome. Appreciate the letter.
16560, Good school
16561, Had a great time with my kids
16562, Yes
16563," Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media."
16564, Thanks 😀
16565, 2020
16566, Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
16567," Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
16568, Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
16569, You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off …
16570, Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
16571, You’re missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
16572," You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
16573, You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
16574," Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
16575," Yup, deleted"
16576, ? It should
16577," No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky 20” tires."
16578," Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes"
16579, Keyword “future” 🤣

16593, Because Twitter is fun
16594, USAToday FTW!
16595,But femtotech is the future …
16596,Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better.
16597,"Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
16598, The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
16599,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
16600, A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
16601," Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
16602," It’s cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a “rocket scientist” in aerospace, they would think you’re 🙃"

16610, What are you talking about? You’re being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
16611," Wow, haven’t watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
16612," Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
16613,Can’t believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
16614," We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"

16619," Earth’s rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
16620, All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
16621, Model 3 was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
16622, This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
16623," Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
16624, Worth a shot
16625, Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
16626," This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
16627,"Problem solved, was able to buy Game on …"
16628," I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!"
16629," Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd …"
16630,"Turns out is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
16631," For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
16632,Tried to buy but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it.
16633," Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
16634, I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
16635, The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
16636, No
16637, Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.
16638," Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
16639," Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
16640, Done
16641, Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
16642, Be careful what you wish for
16643,"Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll🤔"
16644,My point exactly
16645," Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs."
16646, Reddit is great
16647,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
16648, Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
16649," Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
16650, I did to any who asked
16651," That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
16652," Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved"
16653," But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right."
16654," I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
16655, Gasoline or diesel?
16656, What car do you drive?
16657, March 15
16658, The media
16659," Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
16660,Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!”  I do actually own but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News.
16661, Definitely
16662," There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these 🚗 🚙 and this is the best one 🚘"
16663, Yo
16664, That’s the basic idea
16665,"For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too 🚀♥️🌏"
16666," I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
16667," Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
16668, Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
16669," Yeah, I think you do great work"
16670,"If you’re in media &amp; don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …"
16671, 🤗
16672," I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
16673, Of course
16674," It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company."
16675," No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
16676, Will do
16677,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
16678, That’s why editors are included too
16679, We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
16680,"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves."
16681, Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
16682, Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
16683," Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
16684, Exactly
16685,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
16686, An exception that proves the rule
16687," Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
16688,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
16689, The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
16690, Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
16691," Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
16692,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
16693," This will sound super obvious, but Genesis &amp; Oblivion"
16694, I am not cool
16695, The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
16696," Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too ♥️🎼🐇. Her music is incredible."
16697, Thanks. Not super fun right now 😔
16698, Busted 👻
16699," None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
16700," Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
16701, Great idea!
16702, Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
16703, Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
16704, Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
16705," But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote &amp; find out."
16706," In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it."
16707,"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
16708, Good point
16709," No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class “lords &amp; commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
16710," More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …"
16711, No problem
16712," They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
16713," Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
16714, I didn’t meet with him
16715, I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
16716,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
16717," Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
16718," Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
16719," To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
16720, ABS calibration algorithm
16721," Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
16722," Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
16723," Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️"
16724," Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
16725, Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
16726," Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
16727," The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
16728," Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
16729," Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
16730," Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
16731, Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
16732, ♥️🦄
16733," Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
16734, Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
16735," Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal."
16736, We’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation
16737,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to Plum Brook vacuum chamber
16738, For sure before snowfall this year
16739, Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
16740," With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live."
16741, That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
16742, Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
16743," Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
16744," About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
16745, Yes
16746, They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
16747, Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
16748," They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
16749," It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
16750, Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
16751," Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
16752, Good idea ...
16753, That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
16754,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
16755,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
16756, Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
16757,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
16758,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
16759,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
16760," It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
16761, Exactly
16762,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
16763, I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
16764," You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
16765, That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
16766," Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior."
16767," AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in."
16768,Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
16769, Check out Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
16770,But The Boring Company is right behind you at 1/15th your speed &amp; soon will be 1/10th! Start sweating …

16772, Just … an ordinary snail
16773,His name is Gary &amp; he’s a snail
16774,🐌
16775,Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
16776,Excited for partnership with LA Metro
16777,lol
16778,Listening to REALiTi
16779, Yes
16780,Will be presenting &amp; taking questions  about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at 7pm on Thursday
16781,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins
16782," Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
16783," It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
16784,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
16785,"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
16786, Yes
16787," According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
16788," This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
16789, Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
16790," Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
16791,Lovely story
16792," If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I can’t figure them out."
16793," SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets."
16794,Good piece by Ars
16795, Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
16796," Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
16797," Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
16798, Will make that a setting
16799," Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week"
16800, No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
16801," That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass 🎩 …"
16802, I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever  …
16803,Launching in ~4 mins
16804," AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so."
16805," Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …"
16806," I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
16807, Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
16808, A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
16809," Already started DC to NY route. 
Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner."
16810,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final…
16811," Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country &amp; will be there in person for the launch."
16812," This will work on entire S &amp; X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
16813," All X &amp; S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high &amp; you enable feature"
16814," Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
16815, !! Unnecessary characters. Will change.
16816, I wrote that masterpiece myself in HTML 1.0
16817," Wow, thanks for the couch! I will match the donation from my foundation."
16818, My a capella cover of Amish Paradise is irresistible
16819,Tesla quarterly all-hands video. Love the shot of wild horses &amp; Giga in winter
16820, So rococo
16821, Definitely not a logo of any kind
16822, Stole it
16823, We sketched concept together &amp; worked w a trusted team to make it
16824, Glass corset hand-painted in perspective in color of bone. Every detail tells a story. Spiked choker machined from a single piece of forged metal. Crown of Vantablack.
16825, Hi Danielle!
16826," Don’t want to blow your mind, but I’m pretty weird. It’s time the world knew."
16827,Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.
16828, Literally every word is untrue
16829," That’s a white rose on my jacket &amp; the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
16830, This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels &amp; the artists only a small fraction of these numbers
16831," Prob iTunes, but whatever works 4u is fine. Most people don’t buy music &amp; artist earnings from streaming are tiny. Mostly about touring."
16832, Flesh without Blood &amp; Kill V Maim on Art Angels album
16833, Love Powerglide too 
16834, Yes
16837,Rococo basilisk

16840,Warren Buffett is huge in candy. It’s actually true.
16841,I’m killin me lol
16842, lol
16843, Hi Sarah
16844,Then I’m going to build a moat &amp; fill it w candy. Warren B will not be able to resist investing! Berkshire Hathaway kryptonite …
16845,Cryptocandy
16846,"Ok ok, just for sake of argument, what do u wish for in candy? 🍭"
16847, What do you think we’re living in?
16848,It just occurred to me that the plot of Willy Wonka is really messed up
16849,I am super super serious
16850,I’m starting a candy company &amp; it’s going to be amazing
16852, This will be bigger
16853, I try so hard to help them …
16854, Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
16855,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit …"
16856, New Roadster will have that
16857," Yes, definitely not"
16858, It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
16859,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
16860," True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
16861," We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
16862,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
16863,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
16864,"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
16865, Exactly
16866,"First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while"
16867,Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
16868, They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
16869," Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same."
16870," To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
16871," The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."

16900," Yeah, exactly! Would be great to hear your thoughts. We’re going to try a few approaches. Can def be done, just about minimizing mass."
16901," We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesn’t become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore &amp; position catcher ship like Mr Steven."

16910," Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
16911," The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it’s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable &amp; cash flow+ in Q3 &amp; Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
16912," Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is 3 to 6 months."

16943," Uhh, hello, I need to build cars"
16944," About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we don’t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so I’m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell …"
16945," Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
16946," We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn’t matter."
16947," Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …"
16948," Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
16949," Seriously! Obviously, I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
16950," Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
16951," Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven"
16952, What about this?
16953, Elon University is a real place

16959,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt
Palo Alto, California, April 1, 2018 -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."

16985, Shocker
16986, It’s not a political statement and I didn’t do this because someone dared me to do it. Just don’t like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
16987, I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
16988, You’ll live
16989, We’ve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
16990," Instagram’s probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don’t use FB &amp; never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care."
16991, Ok
16992," What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
16993," Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
16994, Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
16995, First time I’ve seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
16996, Maybe that word doesn’t mean what I think it does
16997, Literally never seen it even once

17008," Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new 3 imo, unless you want a smaller car."

17049," To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing."
17050," We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable."
17051," I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It’s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."
17052," Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US"

17095, Strange though. Delta IV Heavy has half the payload of Falcon Heavy and the BO rocket doesn’t exist yet.
17096, I don’t get the little ship thing. You can’t show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat. What if there are Martians? It would be so embarrassing.

17100, Adding software feature to open glovebox automatically when car comes to a stop after a crash. Will look at bonding a thin plastic sheet to the front or back of screen.
17101, Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
17102, Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
17103, No
17104, A Shortfall of Gravitas
17105, A third is under construction
17106," Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected."
17107," Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
17109, Of course :)
17110," Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023"
17111," That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
17112," Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
17113," The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

17179,Unless you like fun
17180,"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one."
17181,"1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left!"
17182,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
17183,Don’t do this
17184, ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I’d be way more scared of a steak knife.
17185,Great for roasting nuts 🔥 🥜
17186,The Boring Company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any party! 
17187,Say hello to my little friend …
17188,Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb 6 from Apollo launchpad 39A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
17189,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so.
17190, Check for updates
17191, Done
17192," Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
17193," Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
17194, That sounds cool. Will do.
17195, Fixed in next release
17196,"Long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (Credit)"
17197, Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
17198, Of course. And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.
17199, Near 405
17201,Falcon Heavy goes vertical
17202,Using a neural net to detect rain using cameras (no dedicated rain or sun sensors). Computers are very patient. 
17203,Come work at the biggest &amp; most advanced factory on Earth! Located by a river near the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains with wild horses roaming free.
17204, Coming very soon
17205, Vastly better maps/nav coming soon
17206, Ok
17207, Sure
17208," Yeah, it’s terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized."
17209, Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I’d like to add.
17210," Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp."
17211," Was gonna say we’ll do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun :)"
17212, Should be in next update
17213, Done
17214, I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.
17215," Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it’s going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience."
17216,"Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. 

So much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you’d truly love. I hope you do.

How can we improve further?"
17217," We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."
17218, The circle is complete
17219, Ok
17220,"Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!"
17221, It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail
17222, True
17223,"So strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the evidence. Given a set of possible explanations, why pick the extremely unlikely one!?"
17224, Yes
17225,Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens …
17226,"When you get the new Tesla software update, go Ho Ho Ho. There’s an Easter egg inside the Easter egg, but it’s not funny."
17227,"46k limited edition boring hats sold, 4K to go. Then flamethrower."
17228,I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever
17229, Isn’t it obvious?
17230,"If you liked tonight’s launch, you will really like Falcon Heavy next month: 3 rocket cores &amp; 3X thrust. 2 cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. 3rd lands on droneship."
17231, Never heard of it
17232,Nuclear alien UFO from North Korea
17233, It was definitely aliens
17234,Launch underway
17235," His “PhD” is in literature (really), presumably bad fiction"
17236, How much is it?
17237,I love Twitter
17238," Bloody hell, I’m going to have to write a blog. Can’t fit this into tweets."
17239, I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
17240," However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
17241," Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
17242," For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
17243," Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”."
17244,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon.
17245, Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.
17246," With people around, so you can see scale"
17247," If things go perfectly, all three rocket booster cores will come back and land. Sides back at the Cape, center on the droneship."
17248,Falcon Heavy launching from same pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
17249,Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.
17250, Hate it when that happens. Some people are so rude!
17251,Falcon Heavy at the Cape
17252, Knight Rider is real
17253,Thanks!
17254," For now, we only use those on super hot reentry missions. Will go to all Ti with Falcon 9 V5, which is a few months away."
17255, Where’s the evidence!?
17256, I also support the Concave Earth and Hollow Globe Societies. Just covering my bases …

17258,42k
17259, Meant to say “sanctimonious idiot”
17260, Good point. It’s just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesn’t actually represent my point of view at all. Other publications referred to it as an “interview”.
17261, You’re an idiot
17262," This depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf, not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there."
17263, Yes

17275,"On Tuesday, SpaceX will attempt to refly both an orbital rocket and spacecraft for the first…"
17276, Yes

17278,The *real* money comes from merchandising. I learned it from this documentary
17279, Deal
17280,"That special hat delivery will take place deep within the real, but fictional (of course), tunnel we are building under LA while you drive the giant machine blindfolded. This will actually happen."
17281, Beyond anything you can imagine
17282," And, at the risk of stating the obvious, extremely boring"
17283, Because it’s stupid
17284, Maybe
17285,Every 5000th buyer of our boringly boring hat will get a free hat signed by the delivery guy
17286,Hat
17287, Yes
17288,"To preserve the transcendent majesty &amp; specialness of The Boring Company cap, we are capping cap orders at 50,000 caps. Almost there ..."
17289, That’s certainly the right way to go to store massive amounts of data for a long time
17290, I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future
17291, Red car for a red planet
17292, Yeah
17293, Yes
17294,Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn’t blow up on ascent.
17295,"Falcon Heavy to launch next month from Apollo 11 pad at the Cape. Will have double thrust of next largest rocket. Guaranteed to be exciting, one way or another."
17296, What does it look like?

17317," For one thing, aliens obv built the pyramids! Who but aliens could have figured out how to align and stack stone blocks in a series of concentric squares!? Um, ok, I guess maybe people."
17318,"Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe … 

Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities."
17319,Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.

17323,"It can transform into a robot, fight aliens and make one hell of a latte"
17324, Do you really believe that someone’s life should be ruined if they make a single offensive comment for which they then sincerely apologize?
17325," That is a *counterpoint* to illustrate absurdity, meaning that obviously a single careless statement should *not* ruins someone’s life"

17384," There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
17385," Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference."
17386," Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now"
17387, Yeah
17388," I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!"

17395,Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks &amp; increase battery production for Puerto Rico &amp; other affected areas.
17396, Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action …
17397, The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
17398," Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
17399," Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"
17400," I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."
17401," Hell yeah, with that crew, we will party like Escobar and Cobain wish they could've partied!!"

17431," Don't give up if the cause is important enough, even if you believe you are walking into doom. Good friends really matter."
17432," Absolutely. Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time."
17433, Does my hivemind count as me?
17434, Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
17435, In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.

17448," Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary."
17449, Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
17450," NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately"
17451," May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory"

17457, In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
17458,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it…

17461, Feature coming soon
17462," They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse …"

17470," Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"

17478," No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
17479, Call it ~800mph
17480,"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only 0.8 miles long. Very high accel/decel needed …"

17482,Just arrived at the competition final. Student teams have amazing talent!
17483, I hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed
17484," Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was &gt;90%."
17486," Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
17487," Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
17488, Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
17489, I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
17490," The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."
17491,"From last year, but still my favorite video of the Falcon 9 rocket booster returning from space…"
17492, SpaceX and The Boring Company are running the Hyperloop competition
17493," Tesla does not really have ""TTunes"". That's a joke."
17494," Will be hanging with my little chum, Gary, on Sunday"
17495, Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here: 🔥💩
17496, It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
17497, WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
17498,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
17499,"Max velocity: Mach 6.9
Max altitude: 247 km
Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
17500, Probably 2m or so
17501, Exactly. Yeah.
17502, Intentionally? Yes
17503, It is approximately the size of a carrot
17504,"Touchdown:
Vertical Velocity (m/s): -1.47 
Lateral Velocity  (m/s): -0.15

17509,New Model X SUV now faster than a $500k Lamborghini
17510," Yeah. It's kinda disgusting, but my boys and I love it :)"
17511,First picture of SpaceX spacesuit. More in days to follow. Worth noting that this actually works…
17512," I would say that is the greatest publication in the history of all conscious beings, living or dead"
17513," I'm not the CEO of Ball Mason Jars. Also, not judging …"
17514,Was at a friend's party this weekend and drank wine from a mason jar
17515, I can't hide the truth any more …
17516, Yes :)
17517,Watching eclipse with sunglasses on through the Model S glass roof. Wow!
17518,SpaceX rocket factory as seen from space
17519," Yeah, but not a priority right now"
17520, I'm not coming for anything. Just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of them.
17521," We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
17522,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
17523, Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
17524, At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
17525, Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
17526, Will prob do something like that
17527, Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
17528," Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
17529," Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
17530, Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
17531, I love Kermit
17532,"But you can check it out on. Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
17533,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
17534," Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
17535, I want one too!
17536,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!"
17537," The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."

17542, Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
17543,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
17544,OpenAI + Dota 2
17545, It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
17546,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
17547," I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
17548,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea."
17549,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess &amp; Go.
17550, Coming soon ...
17551, Hi Mom!
17552, A level 9 orc illusionist and dressmaker
17553, This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least 8 seconds checking your facts.
17554, Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
17555, There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter &amp; maybe 5 to 10 that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
17556," One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
17557," MB was given 52 weeks of salary &amp; stock in appreciation for her great contribution &amp; left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
17558," Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over 10 yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
17559," Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
17560," Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors &amp; never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"
17561, Major increases in the Supercharger and Tesla urban charger network happening over the next several months
17562,First draft animation of the Falcon Heavy three core launch. FH is twice the thrust of the next…

17566,"True, although the changemyview subreddit is least likely to be clicked on by people who really should change their view"
17567,"Arguments, followed, of course, by complaints"
17568, Are you complaining that we are not complaining enough?
17569, And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting… I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
17570, Like I said ...
17571, It gets really dark
17572," True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
17573,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed 1000km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
17574, I guess a proof of concept is needed
17575,Looking forward to launching astronauts to the International Space Station next year!
17576, Sorry about that. You certainly should have been. Will get you guys in a car right away.
17577," No, must brake safely to a halt"

17583," There are several dozen ship names in the Culture series, but I liked those best"
17584, Umm ...
17585," Yeah, it's better than a Model 3. We can put a lot more in a car at a higher price."
17586," I'm sure there are better answers than what I do, which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing"
17587," If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell ..."
17588," Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for."
17589, Yeah
17590," The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two."
17591, Model 3 uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control &amp; lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control
17592,Model 3 Interior
17593, Yes
17594, Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model 3 production hell. More versions = deeper in hell.
17595, Yes
17596, Sure
17597," Watched them personally to make sure &amp; I agree with the outcome. Wouldn't have judged differently. Amazing videos all, but was best."

17612,"Tim's piece on AI is excellent, but we actually face a double exponential rate of improvement. AI hardware &amp; software are both exponential."
17613, I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.
17614, A book of the most beautiful classic cars given to me on my 18th birthday on a farm in Saskatchewan. Van Gogh's Starry Night.
17615, $US price in $AUD plus import duties and sales tax
17616, We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
17617, A 9m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
17618," Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket &amp; spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
17619,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
17620, Kinda have to :)
17621, LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
17622," Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions."
17623, Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
17624," An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
17625, City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
17626,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
17627,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
17628, For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
17629, Support would be much appreciated!
17630,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
17631,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins.
17632," Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship"
17633, y
17634," True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels &amp; confused shorts."
17635, Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
17636, Not true. Email from customer.
17637,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past &amp; present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly …"
17638," Yeah, otherwise hard to find them"
17639, y
17640," Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
17641,It's what you don't say
17642, I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
17643, Good point
17644,Fixed. Now it's good.
17645, Yes
17646, Stay tuned
17647,"Excited to announce the launch of It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
17648," True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
17649,US Senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space
17650," We do that too, but for free"
17651, Hopefully
17652,"Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy."
17653, That doesn't sound right
17654,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not."
17655, Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
17656, Cool!
17657," The very near future, not, like, the far away future"
17658,"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China &amp; Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!"
17659, Of course!

17662, That's probably the best use
17663, Cool 😎
17664, Maybe the upcoming IAC in Adelaide
17665," That pizza looked about as appetizing as drywall. If anything, they were doing people at the party a favor by taking it."
17666," Wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" &amp; didn't even know Leo/Orlando were going. Just went to say hi to my friend Ken Howery."
17667,"Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me."
17669,First Production Model 3
17670," It's who is first to pay full price for the car. Hard rule. I have first Roadster and X, but not first S."
17671," Ira Ehrenpreis had rights to 1st car as he was 1st to place a full deposit, but gave those rights to me as my 46th bday present. Tks Ira!"
17672,Production unit 1 of Model 3 is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
17673,Stop biting my finger dammit 
17674,This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of 3. Australia rocks!!
17675," The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care"
17676," Thanks! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was 28,000 km, Falcon 9 achieved 43,000 km."
17677,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
17678, We're going to spend the 4th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than 5th/6th. Only one chance to get it right …
17679,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
17680,"Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec"
17681,"Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500."
17682,Model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
17683, Norway is awesome
17684," Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones &amp; most laptops are made."
17685,Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good
17686,Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed &amp; built it.
17687, Suggestions welcome!
17688, I think Einstein said that
17689, Or does the Earth move up?
17690, This is a really great floor
17691,Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
17692,Perspective
17693," Nothing to be done, but wait. It's all right here:"
17694, News on Sunday
17695,Because it's off the wall
17696, Maybe it is time for the man cape to return
17697, Didn't read it. Might now though.
17698, Exactly
17699, Me too
17700," Yes, but arguably that's worse"
17701,And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
17702,Just try one. It's way better than you think.
17703, A floor that moves
17704, A ceiling is simply a floor from below
17705,Not as much as tunnels though
17706,They are so underappreciated
17707,They will never let you down
17708,I love floors
17709, Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
17710," Thanks, but I am"
17711,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
17712,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
17713, They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
17714,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it…
17715, More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
17716," Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours."
17717, Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
17718,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
17719, Still humans
17720, Significantly improves control force
17721,Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.
17722,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."
17723," We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago"
17724," Not only that, it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon"
17725, Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
17726," True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
17727," No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds."
17728," They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
17729," Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
17730,Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
17731, Sticking to 100
17732," It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
17733,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
17734,Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
17735," Technically, Ironyman"
17736, Thanks! Looks cool.
17737," Damn, I forgot bacon"
17738,"In life, there are no easy choices …"
17739,Do want irony on social media?
17740,Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
17741, Radiation
17742, Groan
17743," But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise"
17744, Will extend
17745,Over 1000 km should be possible in a 100D with the right tires
17746, Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the 3 meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts &amp; radiative view factor is low.
17747," No plans to change 100 kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model 3 pack is about cost reduction, not performance."
17748,No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
17749, Cool
17750," That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention"
17751," First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model 3 obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot"
17752, No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
17753," This is crazy, but Max Smart mentions Chaos towards the end. Coincidence?"
17754, There's a plot!?

17758, But then I get paid less
17759," Backup valve shows no sign of leaking, but yeah"
17760,If schedule holds there will be two Falcon 9 launches within 48 hours (Cape &amp; Vandenberg) this weekend
17761,"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance."
17762,"Promising conversations with regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes &amp; pedestrians. Permits harder than technology."
17763,It's time they knew …
17764,Tesla service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper 
17765, So soon you won't believe it
17766,Colonizing Mars (thanks Prof Hubbard for creating this from my talk). Major changes to the plan coming soon.
17767,"Hawthorne, California"
17768,Flying through the Falcon Factory
17769,"Mars V2 plan coming soon, which I think addresses the most fundamental flaw in V1: how to pay for development &amp; operation of giant rockets"
17770, Radar-only braking on HW1 is getting better with every release. We're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a UFO in the fog soon.
17771,"$300M cost diff between SpaceX and Boeing/Lockheed exceeds avg value of satellite, so flying with SpaceX means satellite is basically free"

17773,US govt testing by finds Model X to be the safest SUV in history by significant margin
17774," That would an interesting target. Would, of course, only count if capable of doing so right off the production line with street legal tires."
17775," Linux kernel update was way harder than anticipated. Giant improvement, but meant way more OS overhead tuning to keep screen frame rate good"
17776," New kernel goes out next weekend, new web browser next month. Radar-only braking is getting steadily better for both HW 1 and 2."
17777, HW2 Autopilot release should go wide next weekend with additional smoothness improvements to longitudinal control
17778," We are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the moon, Mars &amp; beyond, regardless of nationality"
17779, Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
17780, Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
17781, Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
17782," I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama … Prob worth doing?"
17783, Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.
17784," Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
17785," The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
17786, Damn Stonecutters!
17787," Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees &amp; didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
17788," Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
17789, Exactly
17790,Congrats Robb!
17791, So crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed
17792, You may have Heard of the person who put it together
17793,"Worth watching ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" By. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction …"
17794," If Zedd is kind enough to send me a list, it's on"
17795," All Superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. Over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid."
17796," I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world."
17797," Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that's something"
17798,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought 90% prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."
17799,"They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars"
17800,Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 &amp; then crushed them in a junkyard
17801, That is true. Ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on tap. Nothing else (legal) will get you that.

17803," Good point, will add ""cancel nav"" to voice commands"
17804, Too awesome
17805, Must ipso facto half not bee
17806," First of all, I cracked a long time ago. That's not news. Second, yes, I can see time. How did you know?"
17807," Yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. Will make that change."
17808, Just confirmed the Tesla DJ station works in Canada
17809, Cool
17810," No, it's not!"
17811, Yes
17812, Tap cancel on the screen
17813,"Just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say ""Play Monty Python"" or ""Navigate home"" or anything. Voice commands work pretty well."
17814," Just depends on whether you like a sedan or SUV. Sedan goes faster, SUV has more room."
17815," Yeah, coming back"
17816, Coming soon!
17817, Partly
17818, Possibly my favorite skit
17819, Might work in Canada too
17820, I mean also
17821, Not yet
17822, Yeah
17823,"In the US, you can ask your Tesla to play any Monty Python (or other comedy) skit. Doesn't work outside US yet."
17824," It's on the car. Might add it to the Tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar."
17825, My favorite for sure
17826,Try the new Tesla DJ station on streaming radio
17827, The scene where Brian is saved from the Romans by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best Deus Ex Machina moment of any movie ever
17828," All Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that"
17829, Love Monty Python so much
17831,"Just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me. That hurts, ok?"
17832, Yeah
17833, Yeah
17834,These guys want us to die so bad they can taste it
17835,Could be worse
17836," We can either give up hope &amp; sit in traffic hell forever or try something new. The odds of success may be low, but they're better than zero."
17837, The Boring Company is in Hawthorne and has already approved the permit
17838, Thanks :) Such an outrageous lawsuit. People sometimes underestimate strength of US judiciary. Lot of respect for the judge &amp; jury system.
17839, Almost. Falcon Heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at first.

17846, Of course. What base-number system were you using?
17847,That's why the pic is in black and white. Didn't have color back then.
17848," Yeah, I counted"
17849,Tesla shareholder meeting today. Can't believe it's been 1000 years since we went public.
17850," This is a metaphor for transparency. Also, f* underwear."
17851, Obviously
17852,"SEC disclosures, etc"
17853,"I'm not *saying* they're related, but …"
17854,Or is it more about the way you use it?
17855, I hope I'm wrong
17856, Great comedy! They should write for.
17857, Most likely
17858," Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks."
17859, Probably closer to four or five factories. Logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.
17860, California Cabernet

17865," Most people don't realize you can see Dragon approach the Space Station from the ground, even in LA"
17866,Proud of my Mom ❤️
17867," Yeah, pretty much dead center. We painted the target area with radio reflective paint, which helps the radar be more precise."
17868, Exactly
17869,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars &amp; airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
17870,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today
17871, Good point :)
17872,India commits to sell only electric cars by 2030. It is already the largest market for solar power.
17873,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today"
17874,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
17875, Coming soon
17876, Yeah :)
17877,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain"
17878, And then some
17879," Yeah, it was great!"

17883," I do via my foundation, which is now 16 years old, but my grants are (almost always) anonymous"
17884, Yes
17885, Should finish trans-Canada this year. A stop in Swift Current for sure!
17886, Yes
17887,Comparing Model S vs Model 3
17888,Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks
17889, There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
17890,"Btw, that cloud is almost entirely steam, including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like:"
17891,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ..."
17892, Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to 5 people.
17893, Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
17894, Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
17895, True :)
17896,Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me
17897, All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
17898, I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
17899, Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
17900," Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
17901, We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
17902," Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety"
17903, Exactly
17904, Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
17905, There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
17906, HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
17907, Hopefully June for those too
17908, S for sure. It is a bigger car.
17909," I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3."
17910," Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
17911," Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
17912," Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
17913, That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
17914, Almost there. Probably in a few months.
17915," You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)"
17916,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
17917," Model 3, Model X &amp; Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software."
17918, Wear underpants
17919, Will do
17920, Black and textured slate versions will be
17921, Yes
17922," For reason I can't explain, I find #2 especially odd. Also, not a fan of #17. Has led too many people astray in valuing securities."

17950, Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
17951, Yes. Good.
17952,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
17953,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems &amp; plays. Decided against plays &amp; poems. Too obvious.
17954, That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
17955, This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.

18018, We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
18019, Working on it
18020, Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
18021, A lot

18035, What gave me away?
18036, No
18037,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
18038,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
18039, We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
18040, Yes
18041, Yes
18042, I believe so
18043, Yup
18044, Oh so little faith
18045, The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
18046, Yeah
18047, Start taking orders in April
18048," Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
18049," Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …"
18050, The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
18051," If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
18052, No problem :)
18053," Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
18054, Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
18055," First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months."
18056, Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
18057,First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3
18058, It still has one display
18059, Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
18060," The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
18061, How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
18062," Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
18063, I think so
18064," No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
18065, Tues/Wed
18066, Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
18067, Tues/Wed next week
18068," Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
18069," Yes, but not until next year"
18070, Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
18071," Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
18072, How about now?
18073, Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
18074, All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
18075, Definitely
18076,"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
18077, Yes
18078,"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
18079,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
18080, Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
18081," I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
18082, Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
18083, The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
18084," Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
18085, I hope that didn't work
18086, ~spawn npc.alien
18087,Where are the #%*&gt; aliens?
18088, Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
18089, Except that isn't actually my house ...
18090," Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
18091, I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
18092," 3 is a great car, but definitely Model S"
18093, Good point
18094, I wish. It's so annoying.
18095,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ..."
18096, Ok

18098," Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
18099," Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
18100,".@mcannonbrookes Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
18101,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially"
18102, I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
18103," Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
18104, High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at
18105,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC."
18106,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
18107," Just spoke with, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
18108," Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
18109, $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
18110, Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
18111, Will send you one
18112, Self-hatred
18114,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
18115,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
18116," This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever."
18117,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
18118,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
18119, of course
18120, maybe one of those too
18121,Roller coasters are awesome
18122, Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
18123, Good chance it will
18124, Exactly :)
18125, Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
18126,Excellent Tesla Model X review
18127,Just posted a video
18129, no
18130, System was green for launch. I called it off.
18131," They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
18132," Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
18133,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
18134," Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
18135,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
18136,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
18137,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast…
18138,spacex's photo
18139,"Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018"
18140,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
18141,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
18142," Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
18143, It's much easier to do the CGI that way
18144,Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the 1st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
18145, I used that one :)
18146,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
18147, They are doing India proud
18148, You may come to regret that request :)
18149," Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
18150," Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
18151,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
18152," You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
18153,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
18154,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
18155, Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
18156, Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
18157,Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A. This is the same launch…
18158, Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
18159," Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
18160, of course it will
18161, Should all be uploaded by next month
18162, Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918
18163, I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
18164,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in regarding a carbon tax
18165, yes
18166, Hoping for summer this year
18167," yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
18168," No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100."
18169," Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
18170," No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
18171, Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
18172, yes
18173,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec
18174,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
18175, No rare earth metals in battery
18176, Almost ready
18177, App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
18178," Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority"
18179, I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
18180, Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
18181, A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
18182," Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
18183, People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
18184, Rolling out a new update today.
18185, We should try our best
18186," Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
18187, I just had three coffees :)
18188, Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
18189, Numeric
18190, Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
18191, Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
18192," I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
18193, True. Me being one of them :)
18194," Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
18195," Fair point, sorry"
18196,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
18197, Needs a major overhaul
18198, Exactly
18199, Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
18200, Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
18201," Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
18202," Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)"
18203, Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
18204," Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
18205, Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
18206, You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
18207, Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
18208, Mostly anti-drug laws
18209, Exactly
18210," The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
18211, The remedy for that is changing the law
18212," Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
18213, There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
18214, True!
18215,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
18216, I wish!
18217," Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
18218," Wow, cool!"
18219, That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
18220, Nuances are important :)
18221,26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under D.C.
18222, Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
18223," Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
18224,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
18225,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
18226, First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
18227, maybe
18228,Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the  Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.
18229,Minecraft
18230," Yes. Green cards &amp; dual citizens already ok. Work &amp; spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
18231,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
18232,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
18233, yes
18234, Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
18235," Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
18236,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI
18237," I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
18238," Yeah, sorry about that :)"
18239," Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
18240,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material
18241, Strategic &amp; Policy Forum
18242," Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
18243,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus &amp; present to President.
18244, It is not
18245,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong &amp; don't deserve to be rejected."
18246,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges
18247," This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."
18248,And we start digging the tunnel tonight
18249,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
18250," Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people &amp; it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution &amp; hope good comes of it."
18251," Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
18252," Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX"
18253, Yup
18254, Maybe next month
18255,Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.
18256, I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
18257, No they don't
18258, Was wondering what those were
18259,Sigh
18260, That may be a difficult award to decline
18261,"Tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken"""
18262," ... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""
18263," Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: ""I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ..."
18264," Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ..."
18265, I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
18266," Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
18267," This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
18268, There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
18269," 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely"
18270," Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present"
18271,"Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data."
18272, Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
18273, For now
18274," The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted"
18275, Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
18276," If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically"
18277, Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
18278, Yes
18279," Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way."
18280,Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China!
18281, Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.
18282," Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle."
18283,Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
18284,Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
18285," Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory"
18286, Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
18287," Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot"
18288, It might. Am not sure.
18289, Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
18290,Report highlight: “The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.”
18291,Final report on Autopilot issued by is very positive
18292, One million
18293,Falcon before launch
18294, Not the ideal ending

18301, It does
18302,Liftoff
18303,All satellites deployed
18304,Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship.
18305, Have you tried steam engines? They are amazing.
18306, Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
18307, It is
18308," Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful."
18309," Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1."
18310, It will
18311,Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
18312," If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week"
18313, The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
18314, It will in an upcoming release later this year
18315, Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar &amp; sonar.
18316, Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
18317," Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in."
18318,"If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000"
18319,New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 &amp; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
18320, That was a great game
18321, via
18322,Hold-down firing of Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
18323,HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
18324," Late Jan, along with Linux kernel upgrade"
18325," Yes, but held up by Autopilot . It def works tho in shaving 0.1 sec off 0-60mph &amp; 1/4 mile. If AP goes tmrw, then perf upgrade goes Thurs."
18326,"Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw."
18327,Churchill (non) quotes 
18328, Almost there. Undergoing final validation. Might go out in next few days.
18329,Deus ex machina on the center screen when it ends
18330, Occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future
18331," Yes, grid won't be needed for moderate use Superchargers in non-snowy regions"
18332," A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?"
18333, Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
18334," There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place."
18335," If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back"
18336, Good idea
18337, Yes
18338," Should complete in 2017. One is def planned for Swift Current, near my cousin's wheat farm where I had my 18th bday."
18339," It is keyed off the volume of music in the car. If you turn that down w left scroll wheel, it will be quieter."
18340, Typing Mars after holding down the T symbol on the center console works on S and X. Also try renaming your car 42.
18341,"Make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. Will update over its cell connection too, but takes much longer."
18342,"To activate the Model X holiday performance, just type holidays or ModelXmas after pressing the logo. Also, Mars."
18343, Looking promising for next week
18344," No major precipitating event, but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads"
18345," Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle, ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign"
18346, Night is easy. Twilight is hardest.
18347, That is actually rolling out to all Model X's right now
18348, Yes
18349," 8.1, which hopefully goes out next week."
18350, Hoping for next week. Also going through validation.
18351,Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week
18352,Tesla receives highest owner satisfaction score of any carmaker in Consumer Reports survey
18353,Tesla Autopilot vision neural net now working well. Just need to get a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of environments.
18354, In work
18355, Tesla software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and validation. Getting close.
18356, Should start changing soon
18357,I am actually going to do this
18358," We are going to modify this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. If the site is basically deserted, no problem to park."
18359,"Boring, it's what we do"
18360,"It shall be called ""The Boring Company"""
18361,Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...
18362, You too :)
18363," You're right, this is becoming an issue. Supercharger spots are meant for charging, not parking. Will take action."
18364,Forming a rocket nozzle
18365,A life well lived
18366,"How do we know this story isn't fake? Unfortunately, it is probably true."
18367,Model S smashes into semi truck trailer and lifts it off the ground. Driver walks away.
18368, about three weeks and it will get rolled out incrementally in monthly releases
18369, yes
18370, at least some of them
18371, That doesn't make sense. Will look into it.
18372, About 3 weeks
18373, Backlog of 5 seat foldflat config. 6 seat can be made earlier. Actually my fav version.
18374, Love the pic tho
18375,Can anyone uncover who is really writing these fake pieces? Can't be skankhunt42. His work is better than this.
18376, perfect
18377,Longer version of self-driving demo with Paint It Black soundtrack 
18378, That and Paint It Black will both be uploaded for free as Easter (holiday?) eggs

18381,Tesla self-driving AI with the Benny Hill option package
18382, Consequences of population implosion greatly underestimated. Upside down demographic pyramid can't support social services.
18383, big mobile app update coming with 8.1 next month
18384,Vote tally shows ~85% of unaffiliated shareholders in favor of the Tesla/SolarCity merger! Thanks for believing.
18385, sounds right
18386," All P100D vehicles produced to date, as well as new. This is purely a software optimization."
18387,Model X numbers should also improve by 0.1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile
18388,Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.6 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month
18389," we could enable that, although the cameras use grey, grey, grey, red detection, so it would look a little greyish red :)"
18390,Love you too!
18391," a bit like that, but hopefully a more meaningful role for humans"
18392,Playing Amish Paradise in my Tesla
18393," Both UV and IR (for heat) reflective. I burn easily &amp; then my nose looks like Rudolph the reindeer, so I totally understand."
18394," No, but maybe a light tartan. Plaid is reserved for the next gen Roadster."
18395, I like humanity
18396, there will be something special
18397," Tesla will def absorb SolarCity debt. Altho extremely unlikely, I would pay it personally if need be. Debts must be honored."
18398, My kids and I are having a great time!
18399, next software update fixes that
18400, might have an early access release ready by then
18401, now wouldn't that be interesting :)
18402,Here is how to vote your Tesla and SolarCity shares:
18403, hmmm
18404, one day ...
18405, it is not actually left-handed
18406, unless we do a deployable solar shield like a retractable hard top
18407, currently cycles radio favs. Next software release cycles between favs.
18408,Forgot to mention there will be a P100D Ludicrous Easter egg soon that uncorks the full performance
18409, no
18410, use buttons on left side of steering wheel
18411, Thanks!
18412," I'm the only author, so, love or hate it, that's me. I've learned some lessons though, such as tweeting on Ambien isn't wise."
18413," I personally like the 6 seat best, but the new 5 allows the entire back to fold flat. A small family could camp there!"
18414, We will probably offer that as an option
18415, exactly
18416, Loving this thread :)
18417, Primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. B pillar has a glass overlay.
18418, Excellent safety in rollover (5 star+). That was what took so long to develop.
18419,"In addition, we reinforced the surrounding body structure for improved safety (was already 5 star in all categories)."
18420,"I highly recommend the new all glass roof on the Model S. This was very hard to develop, but it makes the interior feel amazing."
18421, first solar roof deployments will start next summer
18422,Will be on with Ron Baron in about half an hour
18423,Great Model X article by!
18424,"Institutional Shareholder Services, world's top independent evaluator, recommends in favor of Tesla-SolarCity merger"
18425, Congratulations to China on the successful launch of the LM 5 heavy lift rocket!
18426, There would def be millions of agents simultaneously doing a Monte Carlo sim &amp; combining the results to build a map of weaknesses
18427, good chance
18428,Only a matter of time before advanced AI is used to do this. Internet is particularly susceptible to a gradient descent algo.
18429, yes
18430, yes
18431, strongly net positive
18432,"Solar glass tiles can also incorporate heating elements, like rear defroster on a car, to clear roof of snow and keep generating energy"
18433, yes
18434,"Should mention that the Tesla solar roof is robust against any weather, incl heavy hail. Also, higher insulating value than a standard roof."
18435,Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive
18436,"Unveil happening at sunset, because that's when ..."
18437,Solar roof plus Powerwall 2.0 launch event will be webcast live on at 5:30pm PDT tomorrow
18438, Several UI improvements across the board in 8.01 (next few weeks) and 8.1 in Dec
18439,"Solar roof unveil now at 5:30pm sharp (need daylight, for obvious reasons) California time tomorrow."
18440,"Dear cult members, I love you"
18441," fixing, but in a slightly different way"
18442," yeah, great questions"
18443,"This will be under /r/spacex, not the general AMA. Meant to be supplemental to the IAC talk."
18444,AMA at &lt;ahem&gt; 3pm California time
18445,Must be a coincidence
18446," no, that's real"
18447,Using the automated solid metal snake charger :)
18448, yes
18449,"When searching for parking, the car reads the signs to see if it is allowed to park there, which is why it skipped the disabled spot"
18450, yes
18451," 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonars and radar all flush mounted and body color. Beauty remains."
18452,"Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot"
18453, latest autonomous hardware allows for easy computer upgrade
18454,Should mention that retrofitting to full self-driving hardware is very difficult. Cost delta is more than buying a new car. Wish it weren't.
18455, Still working on the video. Fully autonomous drive demo only completed several hours ago.
18456, of course
18457,Tesla expects to demonstrate self-driven cross-country trip next year via
18458, true and underappreciated
18459, This is also what I was alluding to by Model 3 part 2
18460,"According to experts, Hyperloop is both obvious and impossible. Maybe pick one or the other?"
18461,Tesla announcement goes live at 5pm California time. 30 minutes of media Q&amp;A to follow.
18462,Calculated attempt to deceive Florida voters about solar vote uncovered by Miami Herald
18463, This is because the first 12 months of production are sold out
18464,Moving the Tesla announcement to Wednesday. Needs a few more days of refinement.
18465, thanks!
18466, Umm...Autobahn?
18467, obviously wrong
18468, Not actually based on science. Objective data shows Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars.
18469, Sounds like a great move!
18470,Good for Germany!
18471, That's why we need to accelerate solar power
18472,"Real fraud going on is denial of climate science. As for ""subsidies"", Tesla gets pennies on dollar vs coal. How about we both go to zero?"
18473,Translating what actually happened in the debates...
18474, impact velocity and center of mass of colliding object make a big difference
18475, Probably not then either
18476,Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.
18477,"Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th"
18478, I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.
18479,"US automotive deaths rose 10% to 17,775 in first half of 2016, approx 1 every 88 million miles"
18480,Cumulative Tesla Autopilot miles now at 222 million
18481, lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis
18482, Thus I deserve to be top of the target list? Maybe there's a dude who really digs the color gold who is slightly more deserving…
18483," Yeah, and several others at various times. My twitter list is trimmed down to almost all news/comedy these days."

18486," True, it is a no-win situation"
18487, I use twitter for news orgs. My Insta has same women as men. What's up with the phoney PC police axe-grinding?
18488, Exactly. Those are the best ones.
18489, Going out this week for X and outside North America

18496," Corrective action taken. Seems to be limited to a small number of cases, but thanks for letting me know."
18497, Am tracking this down ... Super important to be fair. There are zero discounts even for family and friends.
18498, Something messed up here. Tesla policy is equal pricing for all. No discounts ever unless a car is a floor model or was damaged.

18523," also, the Tesla is poison free!"
18524, can't always detect babies and pets
18525,Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
18526,Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
18527,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
18528,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
18529,"V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments."

18552,Thoughtful Op-ed in Space News much appreciated
18553," Most likely true, but we can't yet find it on any vehicle sensors"
18554,Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.
18555, We have not ruled that out.
18556," nope, it wasn't me"
18557,Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
18558,"Support &amp; advice from,, &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com."
18559,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
18560,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
18561, It's been a little crazy lately
18562," yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine."
18563,Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to  end of weekend
18564,Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
18565," Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change."
18566,We need to do one more minor rev on 8.0 and then will go to wide release in a few weeks
18567,Writing post now with details. Will publish on Tesla website later today.
18568,Major improvements to Autopilot coming with V8.0 and 8.1 software (std OTA update) primarily through advanced processing of radar signals

18583," Yeah. Movie still enjoyable due to some great characters, but plot &amp; editing could've been better. Really needed more Joker+Harley."
18584,Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
18585, Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
18586, probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
18587, Model Y (compact SUV) off Model 3 chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.
18588, good point
18589, I think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after Model Y

18632," Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that ""they know better"". Makes no sense."
18633," V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day."
18634,"Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%."
18635," It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection"
18636, Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
18637,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
18638, That is a very good point!
18639,Have to focus on tonight's launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
18640,"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
18641,"Promising call today with, maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."

18648,Sunday is the end of the week :)
18649, yes
18650, good up to ~160km/h
18651,Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
18652, especially well
18653, Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
18654,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
18655, yes
18656, certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
18657, effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
18658, elevation too
18659, only just gained access to physical vehicle

18676, US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
18677, Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
18678," It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
18679," With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
18680," Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
18681, exactly
18682," that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
18683, why?
18684, thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
18685," you're right, no point"
18686," Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."

18693, thanks
18694," true, good point"
18695," No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony &amp; didn't get my tweet."
18696," cool, thanks :)"
18697, The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
18698," In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
18699," Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."

18703,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)
18704, Exactly! I love Twitter.
18705, Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed
18706," If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about 1M+/year deaths from other auto companies?"
18707," Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market."

18725,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side 
18726,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation."
18727,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
18728,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
18729, Thanks Tyler
18730,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
18731,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
18732, Quite rapid... Yes
18733,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
18734,Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
18735,"Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
18736,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll

18738," Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely."
18739, No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
18740, Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
18741," That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
18742,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
18743," Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
18744,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
18745,"Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
18746,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
18747, That is correct. It was about innovation.

18775,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
18776," Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
18777,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
18778,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
18779,"Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good."
18780,3 mins to launch
18781," There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
18782,Really fun Model X review by. Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
18783," Flight 24 is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
18784,Great image of ancient Mars
18785," No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
18786," Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
18787," Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
18788,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
18789,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
18790," Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
18791, Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
18792,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
18793,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
18794, Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
18795," Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
18796, yes
18797, yup
18798,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."

18805,Ok
18806,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me. 
18807, coming soon
18808, Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
18809, I think so
18810, Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.

18814,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
18815,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
18816,Woohoo!!
18817,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
18818,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery"
18819, yes
18820,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
18821,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
18822," Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
18823, Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
18824, next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
18825, exactly
18826," sides def, center maybe"
18827, naturally
18828,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
18829,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
18830," No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
18831, No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
18832, Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
18833," Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."
18834,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy
18835, yes
18836, turns out it doesn't need securing
18837, yes
18838," yes, several times"
18839, for sure :)
18840, things like this should be purged shortly
18841, 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
18842, Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
18843," JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
18844, System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
18845, of course
18846, Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
18847," Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
18848, Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
18849, checking into it ...
18850, will definitely do so
18851," some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
18852," It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
18853,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
18854,Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
18855," A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
18856, That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
18857,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)
18858," Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster"
18859, We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
18860,By land and sea
18861,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
18862,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
18863,"Godot
Full play"
18864,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
18865, me too!
18866,Great video history of Falcon 9 by Kinematic
18867, needs latest update
18868,"Activate autopilot 4X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
18869," Not from us, but it's awesome"
18870," Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not :)"
18871, Thanks
18872, yes
18873," Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
18874,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
18875, Thanks!
18876, Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
18877,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
18878," Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
18879,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
18880, Nickel is also in nickels
18881," Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
18882,"Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
18883, the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
18884," yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
18885," Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
18886, we will
18887, Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
18888, We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
18889,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S to a Model X
18890,Model X review
18891, probably unwise
18892," won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
18893, yes
18894, yes
18895, yes
18896, sounds good
18897,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
18898, Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
18899," yes, coming this year"
18900, Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
18901, you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
18902, correct
18903, what's the link to that?
18904," No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
18905, no problem
18906, Will cover whole country hopefully this year
18907, less
18908, torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
18909,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
18910,"Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
18911, yes
18912, Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
18913, definitely
18914, should be addressed this year
18915, Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
18916, that's not the real steering system
18917, yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
18918, Some tweaking underway
18919, Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
18920, Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
18921, Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
18922, They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
18923, It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
18924,"A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
18925,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
18926, There will be an optional tow hitch.
18927, Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
18928," cool, thanks!"
18929," Yes, if the trend continues, before"
18930,276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
18931,Model 3 design sketches
18932," We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts."
18933, They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
18934," Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit."
18935," we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
18936," yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
18937, and a few other things
18938,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order."
18939, Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
18940,"Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
18941,253k as of 7am this morning
18942, thanks!
18943,Now 232k orders
18944, of course :)
18945," Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night."
18946, should be within a week or two max
18947," Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car."
18948,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
18949,"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
18950,"Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
18951, Will include India-wide Supercharger network
18952, sure!
18953, Coming in the mail
18954, Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
18955, Just order the SpaceX option package!
18956,"Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level, but that's for later…"
18957," yes, will cover whole country"
18958, yes
18959, sure is
18960, X and S will also be available
18961,"Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland."
18962,"Model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
18963,Online ordering at will now open at 7:30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at 8:30.
18964, From almost anywhere
18965, Coming soon!
18966,"Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up."
18967,Model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm California time at
18968," You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve."
18969,Model 3 order day starting in Australia
18970,You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.
18971,Great article by. Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most
18972,Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model 3
18973,Tesla charger map
18974, being fixed
18975, sure
18976," Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window."
18977, no
18978,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
18979,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this.
18980,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
18981,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory. "
18982, Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
18983,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
18984,"Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions."
18985, We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
18986,.@curtismcauliff SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
18987,Evolution hasn't advanced much
18988,MIT Technology Review 2016
18989, checking ...
18990, exactly :)
18991,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
18992, Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
18993, Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
18994, AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
18995," Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
18996," yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
18997," Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7."
18998," That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
18999, Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
19000,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
19001,Next gen Atlas robot
19002, coming later this year
19003,"There is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%."
19004,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
19005,Just wanted to thank Stu G for Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
19006, Don't you already have a spaceship?
19007,Sigh …
19008, Hi :)
19009," yeah, that's a great one too :)"
19010, Little bit
19011,"Worth watching ""Nathan for You"" on Comedy Central, particularly the ""Dumb Starbucks"" and ""Mechanic/Realtor"" episodes"
19012,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
19013, yes
19014,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
19015," yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
19016,This baby Model S really is quite fun 
19017,More details on Model 3 unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
19018, yes
19019,No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
19020, global
19021,Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
19022, good point
19023,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
19024,Love this Tesla video made by
19025,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret
19026,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
19027, Interesting name
19028, I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
19029,"My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017"
19030, Thanks Jeff
19031,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it…"
19032," Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
19033,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
19034,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
19035, steel collet
19036,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
19037, probably
19038,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
19039,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
19040,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
19041,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."
19042,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
19043,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
19044,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
19045,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
19046,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."
19047,First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
19048,"Worth reading The Machine Stops, an old story by E. M. Forster"
19049,"Falcon 9 back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again."
19050,High res video of landing from the helo

19052,Falcon 9 standing on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
19053, thanks!
19054,There and back again
19055, Thanks Jon!
19056,"11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
19057,Background on the launch
19058,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
19059,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
19060,Meant to reply to this article:
19061,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
19062,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
19063,Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence …
19064,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
19065,About 2 mins from static fire
19066, holding for issue resolution
19067,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
19068,5 mins from static fire test
19069," yes, from 70F to 20 F"
19070, It worked in Texas
19071, -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
19072,Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
19073, Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
19074,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
19075,Announcing formation of …
19076,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the 16th and launch about three days later
19077, Agreed. Working on it.
19078,wow
19079, Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
19080, Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
19081,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
19082,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
19083," Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
19084,"But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15
And Burt Rutan for commercial"
19085,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.
19086," Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago &amp; is still around."
19087, The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
19088,"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
19089,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
19090,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
19091," Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
19092, Yeah and hell yeah
19093, From anywhere
19094,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
19095,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
19096,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot@teslamotors.com."
19097, definitely aliens!
19098, Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
19099, well done!
19100, noted
19101," Wow, that's great!"
19102,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves 2.6 sec 0-60 mph and 10.9 sec 1/4 mile in Motor Trend test
19103," yes, comes with each car"
19104,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"
19105,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
19106,Cool!
19107," Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
19108," Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
19109, Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
19110, We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
19111,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
19112,Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
19113,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
19114," important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
19115, Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
19116,"Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
19117,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
19118, all
19119, Hoping for Friday release
19120, Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
19121,What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the 7.1 UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
19122, already in Jordan. Rest of states in region next year.
19123, thanks Bonnie :)
19124, planning to have a big opening in Mexico City soon and then proceed gradually to central and South America.
19125, me too:
19126, yay! Always happy to make others happy
19127, big UI update coming in V7.1
19128," we won't be, but yes"
19129,"Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important, CR says 97% of owners expect their next car to be a Tesla (the acid test)."
19130,Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
19131, already there
19132,Congrats on driving a Tesla from LA to NY in just over two days!
19133,Autopilot release to Europe and Asia pending regulatory approval. Hopefully get the ok in the next few weeks.
19134, Watched the whole series. One of the best tv shows ever.
19135, sure :)
19136, actually works best at night
19137,Review of Model S by
19138," Depends on regulatory approval, but hopefully end of next week"
19139, 1.5 million miles per day
19140, V7.1
19141," Lots of upgrades and a new look, although main UI upgrade coming with 7.1"
19142, ww
19143, roughly 5 days
19144, same

19728,"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"
19729,Those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong
19730,"More importantly, failed to pay back $1.3B. Apart those 2 points, you were totally 1st"
19731,"As many have already noted, is a division of Fiat, an Italian company. We specifically said first *US* company."
19732,Interview with about Tesla and DOE loan gets into some of the details
19733,Tesla wired the funds to repay the DOE loan today. Only US car company to have fully repaid govt
19734, Physics
19735, I'm a big fan of ultracapacitors. Was going to do my PhD at Stanford on them. But we need a breakthrough in energy density...
19736, High pressure helium pneumatic bolts and pistons. No explosives.
19737," Cool, will get one plus another chicken"
19738, You're welcome. It did seem like the chicken of destiny xx
19739,Petting zoo left a chicken behind at the park. Now we have a pet chicken.
19740, Soon Model S will feature druidic dwarves dancing around a miniature stone henge
19741," Well, you see, by making it go to 11, that makes it louder than loud :)"
19742,Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Something else this week.
19743," physics + a broad range of engineering. Worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history."
19744," Yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the Model S"
19745, we do
19746," Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change"
19747,"Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon &amp; Peter Rive &amp; their awesome team. I'm just a small part."
19748, Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
19749, It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...
19750," Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something."
19751, It can dig up almost anything.
19752," Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately."
19753," Given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story"
19754," Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote &amp; others and streams over 3G (will be LTE later)"
19755," People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way."
19756,"Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python."
19757,"Hold down voice button &amp; say ""Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic"". Model S can play almost any song via Internet."
19758, Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.
19759,There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
19760, Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
19761, Stay tuned
19762,"Just want to say thanks to customers &amp; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you."
19763, Thanks Bill!
19764,"Am a fan of Larry, Sergey &amp; Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here"
19765,"Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck"
19766, exactly
19767,"Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. Still a few years from production."

19769,"Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!"
19770,Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla
19771," Yup, it is super far. Moon is basically in our back yard relative to Mars."
19772," Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places."
19773," Yeah, that probably makes sense."
19774, Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.
19775," yes, that has been the goal from the beginning"

19777," Earnings call next week, then Supercharger week after and then... the mystery announcement/demonstration :)"
19778, you're welcome :)
19779, we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
19780, Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
19781,"  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system."
19782,Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
19783," Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners."
19784, Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
19785," We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway."
19786," Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform."
19787," Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better."
19788," The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy"
19789, More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
19790, We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
19791, High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
19792,"F9R (pronounced F-niner) shows a little leg. Design is a nested, telescoping piston w A frame."
19793, This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part 4 yet.
19794,Time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). Tesla announcement tomorrow.
19795," We're aiming for late 2015, but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same"

19805," Am for good public transit in LA, but the pace of that construction makes the 405 look fast."
19806, This argument is a bit silly. A city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn't traffic.
19807," Cool, thanks for buying our car!"
19808," Thanks, important clarification. Tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. Market follows eventually."
19809,Announcement of new strategy tomorrow. Tesla owners will like this.

19832,"New York judge states: ""... dealers cannot utilize the Franchised Dealer Act as a means to sue their competitors"". Exactly!"
19833,"New York judge just ruled in favor Tesla, dismissing the legal attack by auto dealers to prevent direct sales!"
19834,Yay for democracy! asks: Should Tesla Motors be able to sell directly to consumers?
19835," Yup, you're right"
19836,Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in Austin. Will hang around after press conf to thank people in person.
19837," already partly here with rocket development, but will make it a lot bigger with the launch site"
19838,Just had Texas BBQ for lunch in Capitol Building. About to head to House Committee hearing to advocate for Tesla in TX.
19839,In TX to make the case for allowing Tesla to sell cars. Pls come to Capitol Room E2.014 at 1:30!
19840,Which leads me to my next subject of gun control ... just kidding
19841,No more political comments for me now that I've shot off both my feet.
19842,"At the risk of losing more ""cool points"", I like Reagan too! However, I also like Obama, Clinton &amp; JFK. Good people on both sides..."
19843," Am not trying to accumulate cool points. She was far from perfect, but her actions, on balance, were good."
19844," Her later years are debatable, but her early years are not imo. Britain went from dreary to Great again."
19845,"Always admired Margaret Thatcher -- she was tough, but sensible &amp; fair, much like my English Nana"
19846, We went through literally hundreds of variants of red trying to find something original that didn't suck.

19861, Thanks Jeremy! Good seeing you in LA. Awesome job with Yelp!
19862,"To be clear, Tesla is in California, so it is not April Fool's yet! Also, some may differ, but imo the Tues news is arguably more important."
19863,First profitable Q for Tesla thanks to awesome customers &amp; hard work by a super dedicated team
19864,About to do chocolate egg hunt with all the kids. Candy bonanza! Happy Easter!

19880, It will be slightly smaller w fewer features as std. Think Audi A4 or BMW 3 vs Model S being S7 or M5
19881, yep
19882, sure :)
19883,.@jbmeicher Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
19884,"But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride"
19885,.@benmacy $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
19886,".@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner."
